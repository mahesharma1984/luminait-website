# P-GTM: Partnership Go-to-Market

**Version:** 3.0  
**Date:** January 23, 2026  
**Consolidates:** v2.2, v2.3 (Access Pathways), v2.4 (Proof Requirements), Stage 1.3 (Market Modifiers), Stage 2.1 (Partner Variables)

## What It Is

A framework for finding the highest-alignment configuration of your assets, a target market, and a partner—then building toward that configuration.

**Core principle:** Start by defining what blocks you, then find markets outside that blocking system, then find partners who can build a containing structure with you.

---

## Structure

**Part A: Configuration Selection**
- Stage 0: Define the Blockage
- Stage 1: Assets + Markets (with Market Context Modifiers)
- Stage 2: Partners (with Entry Mechanisms)
- Stage 3: Alignment Scoring + Selection (with GCE gates)
- Stage 3B: Sequencing (with Proof + Access analysis)

**Part B: Execution Planning**
- Stage 4: Product + Business Model
- Stage 5: Distribution
- Stage 6: First Slice + Assets

---

## Part A: Configuration Selection

### Stage 0: Define the Blockage

**Purpose:** Define the specific system that blocks you. "Gap" is relative—outside *this* system.

**0.1 The Blocking System**

| Question | Your Answer |
|----------|-------------|
| What institution/credential regime currently excludes you? | |
| What credentials are you missing? | |
| What reputation signals are you missing? | |
| How does gatekeeping actually work? (mechanisms) | |

**0.2 Gap Definition**

Based on the above, define what "outside the gap" means:

```
A market is OUTSIDE THE GAP if:
- [Criterion 1 based on your blocking system]
- [Criterion 2]
- [etc.]
```

---

### Stage 1: Assets + Markets

**1.1 Your Assets (Fixed)**

| Asset Category | What You Have |
|----------------|---------------|
| Methodology | |
| Content | |
| Tools | |
| Network | |
| Credibility markers | |

**1.2 Market Candidate Generation**

| Market ID | Description | Gap Status | Why Outside Gap? |
|-----------|-------------|------------|------------------|
| M1 | | | |
| M2 | | | |
| M3 | | | |

**1.3 Market Context Modifiers**

Adjust market attractiveness based on structural factors:

| Dimension | Scale | What It Captures |
|-----------|-------|------------------|
| Policy direction | -2 to +2 | Is regulation moving toward or away? |
| Economic trajectory | -1 to +1 | Growth conditions |
| Partnership culture | -1 to +1 | Power dynamics in relationships |

**Scoring:**

| Policy Direction | Meaning | Score |
|------------------|---------|-------|
| Actively restrictive | Bans, crackdowns enacted | -2 |
| Trending restrictive | Tightening regulations | -1 |
| Neutral/stable | No significant movement | 0 |
| Latent enabling | Policy shift emerging | +1 |
| Actively enabling | Mandate enacted, funding allocated | +2 |

**Multiplier Conversion:**

| Raw Score | Multiplier |
|-----------|------------|
| -4 to -3 | 0.70-0.75× |
| -2 to -1 | 0.80-0.90× |
| 0 | 1.00× |
| +1 to +2 | 1.10-1.15× |
| +3 to +4 | 1.20-1.25× |

**1.4 Gap Pre-Check**

For each market, verify it's genuinely outside the blocking system before proceeding.

### Stage 2: Partners

**2.1 Partner Variables**

| Variable | Options |
|----------|---------|
| Type | Individual tutor, Teacher, Agency, Platform, **Institutional gatekeeper** |
| Structure | Co-build, Established |
| Has | Students, Parent trust, School access, Delivery capacity, Government relationships, Licensing authority |
| Lacks | Methodology, Differentiation, Materials, Systems, Western expertise |
| Accessibility | Direct, One hop, Cold |
| Entry Mechanism | Direct hire, MoU/Partnership, Visa sponsorship, Capital requirement, Licensing |

**Institutional gatekeeper:** Controls market access; sponsors foreign entry; government-adjacent. Use when:
- Market requires formal entry (visa, registration)
- Government relationships required
- Foreign expertise needs sponsorship

**2.2 Partner Candidates**

| Market | Partner ID | Type | Structure | Has | Lacks | Access | Entry Mechanism |
|--------|------------|------|-----------|-----|-------|--------|-----------------|
| M1 | P1a | | | | | | |
| M1 | P1b | | | | | | |
| M2 | P2a | | | | | | |

**2.3 Access Pathway Types**

| Pathway Type | Mechanism |
|--------------|-----------|
| Direct | Existing relationship |
| One hop | Intro via mutual connection |
| Community | Visible in shared space |
| Asset-led | Work creates inbound |
| Network event | Structured introductions |
| Sequential | Requires prior partnership |

**2.4 Your Access Assets**

| Asset | Pathway It Creates | Current State |
|-------|-------------------|---------------|
| | | Ready / Needs work / Dormant / Missing |

**2.5 Partner Access Assessment**

| Partner ID | Current Access | Pathway Type | Effort to Warm |
|------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| P1a | | | Low / Medium / High |

---

### Stage 3: Alignment Scoring

**3.1 GCE Gates (Must Pass)**

Before scoring, verify each config passes GCE requirements:

| Gate | Question | Pass/Fail |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Gap | Is this genuinely outside the blocking system? | |
| Container | Does the partner have infrastructure to hold value exchange? | |
| Exchange | Is there a clear value exchange that works for both parties? | |

Configs failing any gate are eliminated regardless of score.

**3.2 Alignment Variables**

| Variable | Weight | Scoring |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Asset-Need Fit | ×4 | 0-2: How well do your assets fill their gaps? |
| Accessibility | ×3 | 0-2: See pathway-adjusted scoring below |
| Container Readiness | ×2 | 0-2: How ready is their infrastructure? |
| Exchange Viability | ×1 | 0-2: How clear is mutual value exchange? |

**Accessibility Scoring (pathway-adjusted):**

| Current Access | Pathway | Effort | Score (×3) |
|----------------|---------|--------|------------|
| Direct | — | — | 6 |
| One hop | — | Low | 6 |
| One hop | — | Medium | 5 |
| Cold | Yes | Low | 5 |
| Cold | Yes | Medium | 3 |
| Cold | Yes | High | 2 |
| Cold | No | — | 0 |

**3.3 Scoring Matrix**

| Config | Asset Fit (×4) | Access (×3) | Container (×2) | Exchange (×1) | Base Score | Market Modifier | Adjusted |
|--------|----------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|------------|-----------------|----------|
| C1a | | | | | /16 | ×1.00 | |

**3.4 Config Selection**

Rank by adjusted score. Top 3-5 configs proceed to sequencing.

---

### Stage 3B: Sequencing

**3B.1 Sequencing Principle**

```
Score = where to aim
Proof requirement = what unlocks it
Access = whether pathway exists
Sequence = build proof before approaching those who require it
```

**3B.2 Proof Requirement Analysis**

| Partner Type | Evaluates On | Proof Required |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| Solo founder | Problem-solution fit | Demo, methodology |
| Small team | Differentiation | Demo + integration path |
| Angel investor | Working model | Partnership proof |
| Family office | Vision, early signal | Partnership + credibility |
| Academic | Novelty, rigor | Paper, methodology |
| Institutional investor | Traction, team | Multiple proof dimensions |
| Established company | Integration value | Proven product, case studies |

**Proof categories:**

| Category | Who Accepts |
|----------|-------------|
| Asset-based (demo, paper) | Founders, academics |
| Partnership-based | Angels, family offices |
| Traction-based | Institutional investors, companies |

**3B.3 Your Proof Inventory**

| Proof Type | Asset | State | Who Accepts |
|------------|-------|-------|-------------|
| Demo | | Built / Not built | |
| Paper | | Draft / Published | |
| Partnership | | None / In progress / Complete | |
| Traction | | None / Early / Significant | |

**3B.4 Proof-Access Matrix**

| Config | Score | Access | Proof Required | Have Proof? | Creates Proof For |
|--------|-------|--------|----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| C1a | /16 | | | ✓/✗ | |

**3B.5 Sequencing Template**

| Phase | Config | Proof Required | Have It? | Access | Creates Proof For |
|-------|--------|----------------|----------|--------|-------------------|
| 0 | — | — | — | [Actions: access + proof creation] | Phase 1 |
| 1 | [Entry] | Asset-based | ✓ | | Phase 2 |
| 2 | [Middle] | Partnership-based | Via Phase 1 | | Phase 3 |
| 3 | [Target] | Traction-based | Via Phase 2 | | — |

**3B.6 Phase 0 Logic**

Phase 0 applies when:
- Best-scoring config is currently Cold AND has viable pathway
- Proof can be built without partnership first
- Action is bounded (publish paper, ship tool, activate network)

Phase 0 includes:
- Access creation: Activate dormant pathways, publish assets
- Proof creation: Ship public tool, complete research
- Or both: Publish paper (creates access + credibility)

**3B.7 Sequencing Decision Tree**

```
START
  │
  ▼
For each config:
  │
  ├── "What proof does this partner require?"
  │
  ├── "Do I have that proof now?"
  │     │
  │     ├── YES → Check access
  │     │          ├── Accessible → CAN START HERE
  │     │          └── Not accessible → Add to Phase 0
  │     │
  │     └── NO → "What prior config creates that proof?"
  │               └── Sequence that config BEFORE this one
  │
  ▼
Build sequence from lowest proof requirement to highest
```

## Part B: Execution Planning

### Stage 4: Product + Business Model

For the selected config sequence, define:

| Element | Phase 1 Config | Phase 2 Config | Phase 3 Config |
|---------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Product form | | | |
| Revenue model | | | |
| Delivery mechanism | | | |
| Your role | | | |
| Partner role | | | |

### Stage 5: Distribution

For each phase, define distribution approach:

| Phase | Entry point | Channel | Primary message |
|-------|-------------|---------|-----------------|
| 1 | | | |
| 2 | | | |
| 3 | | | |

### Stage 6: First Slice + Assets

For Phase 1 (entry config):

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| Atomic unit of value | |
| First delivery mechanism | |
| Assets needed | |
| Success signal | |
| Timeline | |
