# PMF Framework: Text-Specific Secondary English Tutoring

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2026

---

## 1. PMF SUMMARY

**Market:** Parents of Y7-10 students at Melbourne independent/selective schools whose children are assigned specific literature texts for English class.

**Problem:** Students must study and be assessed on specific texts, but schools lack instructional time to teach comprehension deeply, and generic tutoring doesn't address the specific text. Parents cannot help (they haven't read the book).

**Solution:** Cohort-based classes built around the exact text the student is studying, using a systematic methodology that teaches how to read, analyse, and write about *this* text.

**Fit:**
- Demand is curriculum-mandated (not optional)
- Timing is predictable (school terms, assessment periods)
- Content is reusable (same text = same materials across schools)
- Parent is decision-maker (Y7-10, unlike VCE)
- LTV is high (4 years of potential engagement)

## 2. EVIDENCE BASE

### 2.1 The School Constraint (Instructional Time)

**Research finding:** Australian teachers report insufficient time for reading comprehension instruction.

> "Few parameters are set regarding how instructional time is allocated and for what purpose... The teaching of reading comprehension is inherently a complex task."
> — Australian Journal of Language and Literacy (2023)

> "Nearly half the sample reported teaching bespoke reading comprehension lessons for up to 30 min a day... there is a discrepancy between research findings and enacted practices in the classroom."
> — Teachers Teaching Reading Comprehension study (2024)

**NAPLAN data (2024):**
- 1 in 3 students fail to meet proficiency benchmarks in literacy
- Reading proficiency drops from Y5 (71.4%) to Y9 (63%)
- Writing proficiency drops from Y3 (76.8%) to Y9 (61%)

**Implication:** Schools are structurally constrained. Teachers don't have time to teach text comprehension deeply. Students are expected to read independently and come to class for assessment.

### 2.2 The Tutoring Market

**Market size:**
- Australian tutoring market: ~AUD $1.25 billion (2017), growing
- ~46,000 tutors nationally (2019), doubled from 2014
- Average family spending: $58/month on tutoring (2021)

**Market structure:**
- Dominated by generic "English skills" tutoring
- Text-specific matching is reactive ("just ask them which texts they know")
- Group classes require self-forming (bring your friends studying same text)
- No provider systematically builds classes around prescribed texts

**Parent spending patterns:**
- Higher-income parents spend significantly more on tutoring
- 31% of upper-middle-class parents use private tutoring vs. 6% of working-class
- Victoria has lower tutoring spend than NSW (different exam structures)

### 2.3 The Text Assignment Structure

**VCAA text list mechanics:**
- 40 texts on VCE English list
- ~25% rotate annually (max 4 years on list)
- Schools choose from approved list

**Lower secondary (Y7-10):**
- No central list — schools choose independently
- Significant overlap across schools (Macbeth at 4 schools, Animal Farm at 2, etc.)
- Booklists often publicly available

**Booklist data (7 Melbourne schools verified):**
- Y7: *Holes*, *Things a Map Won't Show You* at 2+ schools
- Y8: *The Giver*, *Twelve Angry Men*, *The Hunger Games* at multiple schools
- Y9: *Animal Farm*, *Curious Incident* at multiple schools
- Y10: *Macbeth* at 4 schools, *Station Eleven*, *Romeo and Juliet* at 2+ schools

## 3. THE LOGIC CHAIN

```
REQUIREMENT
Students must study specific texts (Victorian Curriculum mandate)
          ↓
SCHOOL FAILURE
Teachers have ~30 min/day for reading comprehension (research)
Class sizes 25-30, competing demands
Text reading assigned as homework, not taught
          ↓
OUTCOME GAP
1 in 3 students fail NAPLAN literacy benchmarks
Reading proficiency drops Y5→Y9 (71%→63%)
Students don't understand the text they're assessed on
          ↓
TUTORING FAILURE
$1.25B market, but generic "English skills" focus
Text-specific matching is accidental, not systematic
No provider builds reusable content around prescribed texts
          ↓
PARENT PAIN
"My child has to study [Text] but doesn't understand it"
Parent can't help (hasn't read the book)
Generic tutoring doesn't address the specific text
          ↓
YOUR FIT
Systematic methodology + text-specific materials
Cohort classes (students studying same text)
Reusable content (same text = same materials across schools)
Parent decision-maker, high LTV (4 years)
```

## 4. TWO STRATEGIES (SEPARATED)

### Strategy A: Lower Secondary Text-Specific Tutoring

**Target:** Parents of Y7-10 students

**Model:** Traditional tutoring, text-specific cohorts

**Entry:** Referral, school networks, local marketing

**Offer:** "Master *[Text Name]* in 10 weeks"

**Delivery:** Small group classes (3-6 students), same text

**Revenue:** $500-700/term

**Scale mechanism:** Build materials for top 15 texts → recruit across schools

**Key advantage:** Parent is buyer, LTV is high, methodology fits

---

### Strategy B: VCE Analysis Guides (Separate Business)

**Target:** VCE students (Y11-12)

**Model:** Hub-and-spoke SEO content, e-learning

**Entry:** Student searches "[text name] analysis"

**Offer:** Free guide (Steps 1-4), gated one-sheet (Step 5)

**Conversion:** Bridge to parent is weak (student-driven decision)

**Revenue:** Lower, less reliable

**Scale mechanism:** Content scales infinitely, but conversion is harder

**Key distinction:** This is a content/brand play, not a tutoring business. It builds audience and credibility, not direct revenue.

---

## 5. ADDRESSABLE MARKET (CONSERVATIVE)

**Based on 7 verified schools:**
- 7 schools × 200 students/year level × 4 year levels = 5,600 students
- 10% seek external tutoring = 560 students
- 10% capture rate = 56 students/year
- $500/term × 4 terms = $2,000 LTV
- 56 students × $2,000 = **$112K potential revenue**

**Scalability levers:**
1. Add more schools' booklists
2. Build materials for more texts
3. Increase capture rate through referrals

---

## 6. DATA GAPS TO FILL

| Question | Why It Matters | How to Fill |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Which texts are most popular across Melbourne? | Prioritise material development | Expand booklist collection (more schools) |
| What's the actual overlap rate? | Determines cohort viability | Analyse booklist data systematically |
| What do parents actually search for? | Informs marketing | Keyword research, parent interviews |
| What's the conversion rate from referral? | Business model viability | Track early cohorts |

---

## 7. NEXT STEPS

1. **Expand booklist data** — collect from 15-20 more schools
2. **Identify top 10 texts** — by cross-school frequency
3. **Build first text module** — likely Macbeth (4 schools confirmed)
4. **Test parent messaging** — "Master [Text] in 10 weeks"
5. **Run pilot cohort** — validate conversion and retention
