# Distribution Strategy: Reading-Writing Funnel + PLG Mapping

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2026  
**Dependencies:** PMF Addendum v1.0, PLG-PMF Alignment v1.0, KDD Addendum v1.0  
**Purpose:** Core reference for designing all marketing assets (website, flyers, social, etc.)

## 1. THE STRATEGIC INSIGHT

Reading and writing are not equivalent selling points. They occupy different positions in the customer journey and require different distribution strategies.

| Dimension | Reading (Text-Specific) | Writing |
|-----------|------------------------|---------|
| Funnel role | Entry mechanism | Retention mechanism |
| SEC classification | Search attribute (verifiable) | Pure credence (unverifiable) |
| Parent evaluation | "Do they teach [Text]?" — Yes/No | "Is my child a better writer?" — Can't judge |
| Purchase friction | Low | High |
| PLG readiness | High (~3.5+) | Low (~1.8) |

**The core principle:** Lead with reading (verifiable, low friction) to bypass the credibility trap. Let writing be discovered through delivery (high value, retained through experience).

---

## 2. PLG-PMF MAPPING

### 2.1 The Diagnosis

Your core product (TVODE writing methodology) sits in **Quadrant A** of the PLG-PMF matrix: High PMF, Low PLG.

| Dimension | Writing (Core) Score | Notes |
|-----------|---------------------|-------|
| Time to Value | 2 (Slow) | Value emerges over weeks of practice |
| Demonstrability | 1.5 (Deferred) | Requires teacher to confirm quality |
| Aha Clarity | 2 (Expert-judged) | Student can't self-assess improvement |
| **PLG Score** | **1.8** | Distribution bottleneck |

**PMF Evidence:** Strong (80% retention, measurable improvement, 100% consultation conversion). The product works — it just can't demonstrate that it works without assistance.

### 2.2 The Solution: Hybrid Funnel with Reading Entry Point

Quadrant A prescription: Build a PLG-ready entry point that funnels to the non-PLG core.

**Reading-based entry point:**

| Dimension | Reading Entry Score | Notes |
|-----------|---------------------|-------|
| Time to Value | 4+ (Fast) | Instant text match verification |
| Demonstrability | 4 (Observable) | Guide quality visible immediately |
| Aha Clarity | 4 (Progressive) | "I see what good analysis looks like" |
| **PLG Score** | **~4.0** | PLG-ready |

**The reading slice IS the entry point.** It converts the distribution bottleneck into a hybrid funnel where:
- Reading (text-specific guides, resources) = PLG entry
- Writing (TVODE workbooks, tutoring) = Education funnel core

## 3. FUNNEL ARCHITECTURE

### 3.1 The Logic Chain

```
STAGE 1: CAPTURE (PLG — Reading)
    │
    ├── Trigger: Parent/student searches "[Text] analysis"
    ├── Asset: SEO page, guide, diagnostic
    ├── Value delivered: Text-specific insight (observable)
    ├── Credibility required: None (search attribute)
    │
    └── OUTCOME: Traffic captured
            │
            ▼
STAGE 2: AHA MOMENT (PLG — Reading)
    │
    ├── Trigger: User consumes guide content
    ├── Asset: Guide with TVODE demonstration
    ├── Value delivered: "I see what sophisticated analysis looks like"
    ├── Credibility required: Low (quality self-evident)
    │
    └── OUTCOME: Method becomes visible
            │
            ▼
STAGE 3: GAP REVEALED (Hybrid — Bridge)
    │
    ├── Trigger: User attempts to replicate method OR completes diagnostic
    ├── Asset: Diagnostic tool, gated content, CTA
    ├── Value delivered: "I can see what I'm missing"
    ├── Credibility required: Medium (methodology understood)
    │
    └── OUTCOME: Need for structured learning established
            │
            ▼
STAGE 4: CONVERSION (Education Funnel — Writing)
    │
    ├── Trigger: CTA to workbook/consultation
    ├── Asset: Landing page, consultation, enrollment
    ├── Value promised: Writing improvement via TVODE
    ├── Credibility required: Built through Stages 1-3
    │
    └── OUTCOME: Enrollment
            │
            ▼
STAGE 5: RETENTION (Education Funnel — Writing)
    │
    ├── Trigger: Weeks 3-4 of delivery
    ├── Asset: Progress reports, before/after work
    ├── Value delivered: Writing improvement observed
    ├── Credibility: Confirmed through experience
    │
    └── OUTCOME: Retention, referral
```

### 3.2 Acquisition vs Retention Summary

| Funnel Stage | Primary Lever | Message Type | Asset Type |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| Awareness | Text match (reading) | Concrete, verifiable | SEO, social |
| Consideration | Methodology visibility | "Here's how it works" | Guide, video |
| Decision | Gap revealed | "Here's what you're missing" | Diagnostic, CTA |
| Purchase | Credibility earned | "This method delivers" | Landing page |
| Retention | Writing improvement | "Look at your progress" | Reports, feedback |
| Referral | Writing outcomes | "My child writes better" | Testimonials |

---

## 4. CREDIBILITY SEQUENCE

Traditional education requires credentials you don't have. This strategy bypasses the credibility trap.

### 4.1 The Bypass Mechanism

| Traditional Credibility | Your Substitute | How It Works |
|------------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Degree/qualification | Visible methodology | TVODE structure shown in guides |
| School reputation | Text-specific match | "We teach [Text]" = search attribute |
| Years of experience | Before/after samples | Student work demonstrates outcomes |
| Testimonials | Progress reports | Parent observes improvement directly |

### 4.2 Credibility Stages

```
STAGE 1: NO CREDIBILITY REQUIRED
────────────────────────────────
Message: "We teach Animal Farm in Term 2"
Mechanism: Search attribute (binary verification)
Asset: Text list, course schedule, SEO page

        ↓

STAGE 2: CREDIBILITY EARNED
────────────────────────────────
Message: "Here's how we teach close reading using TVODE"
Mechanism: Methodology visibility (structure shown, not evaluated)
Asset: Guide, video demonstration, diagnostic

        ↓

STAGE 3: CREDIBILITY CONFIRMED
────────────────────────────────
Message: "Here's your child's essay — before and after"
Mechanism: Outcomes observed (parent sees improvement)
Asset: Progress report, marked work, feedback

        ↓

STAGE 4: CREDIBILITY TRANSFERRED
────────────────────────────────
Message: "My child writes better across all subjects now"
Mechanism: Credence value realised (referral-ready)
Asset: Testimonial, case study, word-of-mouth
```

## 5. MESSAGING RULES

### 5.1 Lead with Reading (Acquisition)

**DO use:**
- "Master [Text Name] in 10 weeks"
- "Your child is studying [Text] — we teach it"
- "Text-specific classes for [School]'s English curriculum"
- "[Text] analysis guide — free download"
- "What [Text] is really about"

**DON'T use (in acquisition):**
- "Improve your child's writing skills"
- "Learn analytical techniques"
- "Develop critical thinking"
- "Better essays guaranteed"

**Why:** The reading message is concrete, verifiable, and urgent. The writing message is abstract and requires trust you haven't earned yet.

### 5.2 Reveal Writing Through Delivery (Retention)

Writing improvement is communicated AFTER enrollment, not before:
- Progress reports showing essay development
- TVODE feedback demonstrating reasoning improvement
- Parent observation of homework quality
- Cross-subject transfer noted

**The parent discovers writing value — they don't buy it upfront.**

### 5.3 Referral Messaging Inverts

Once trust is established, referral messaging CAN lead with writing:
- "My child's essays are so much better now"
- "They actually understand how to argue a point"
- "The skills transfer to other subjects"

**Why:** Referral comes from parents who have experienced the credence value. They can communicate it because they've seen it.

## 11. SUMMARY

**The strategic sequence:**

```
READING pulls them in → METHODOLOGY builds trust → WRITING keeps them there
```

**Applied to assets:**

| Asset Type | Lead With | Support With | CTA To |
|------------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| SEO / Guides | Text-specific insight | Method visibility | Diagnostic / Download |
| Social | Text hooks | Method demos | Guide page |
| Flyers | Text list | Method mention | Guide QR |
| Landing page | Method + outcomes | Credibility | Enrollment |
| Progress reports | Outcomes observed | Next term preview | Retention |
| Referral | Writing outcomes | Personal story | Share / Enroll |

**The principle in one line:**

> Lead with what they can verify (reading). Deliver what they can't evaluate (writing). Let experience do the selling.
