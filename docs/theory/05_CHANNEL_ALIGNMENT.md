# 05: Channel Alignment — Interpretation vs Annotation

**Purpose:** Align interpretation/pattern content (credence) with annotation method content (action) across channels, without mixing jobs.

**Related:**
- `01_CREDENCE_PROBLEM.md` — why proof must be visible
- `02_CUSTOMER_JOURNEY.md` — funnel stages and entry paths
- `03_VALIDATION_LOOP.md` — friction rescue via proof
- `04_CONTENT_DERIVATION.md` — kernel → message → funnel
- `../technical/SITE_ARCHITECTURE.md` — page roles and URLs
- `../technical/FUNNEL_STRATEGY.md` — parent-direct primary path

## 1. The Core Alignment Problem

We need two content tracks that share the same kernel but serve different jobs:

- **Interpretation / Pattern** builds *credence* (visible expertise).
- **Annotation Method** builds *action* (doable next step).

Mixing these jobs in single short-form assets reduces clarity and weakens conversion.

## 2. Credence Mechanics (Why Interpretation Works)

Interpretation/pattern content converts a credence good into something observable:

- **Pattern name** shows depth of analysis.
- **Anchor quote** shows evidence.
- **Reader effect** shows analytical coherence.

This is the Stage 2 → Stage 3 credibility bridge:

1) **Text Match** (binary) →
2) **Preparation Proof** (outline) →
3) **Method Visibility** (pattern interpretation) →
4) **Outcomes** (reports, after purchase)

Annotation then *demonstrates the method* for turning pattern insight into student output.

## 3. Two-Track Model (One Kernel, Two Jobs)

### Track A — Interpretation / Pattern (SEO)
**Job:** Build credence + capture intent
**Audience:** Searchers (parents/students)
**Primary Assets:**
- Text guide page (interpretation)
- Parent outline (`/[text-slug]/` or `/curriculum/[slug]/`)
- Pattern-reveal video (30s)
**Primary CTA:** Parent outline or course

### Track B — Annotation Method (Social)
**Job:** Demonstrate method + enable action
**Audience:** Social discovery (students/parents)
**Primary Assets:**
- Annotation guide (preview + download)
- Annotation demo video (30s)
- Snippet posts (annotated excerpt)
**Primary CTA:** Annotation download → parent outline

**Rule:** Interpretation = meaning. Annotation = method.

## 4. KDD-Style Derivation (Input → Output)

**Shared Kernel Inputs:**
- Pattern name, core dynamic, reader effect
- Anchor quote and device evidence
- Semantic families / lens

**Track A Outputs (Interpretation):**
- Guide page: hook + pattern reveal + evidence
- Pattern video: 1 pattern, 1 quote, 1 effect
- Parent outline: 10-week plan for the text

**Track B Outputs (Annotation):**
- Annotation guide: color key + activities + examples
- Annotation demo video: 1 passage + 1 lens
- Social snippets: 1 quote + 1 marking instruction

---

## 5. Messaging Guardrails

**Interpretation messaging (SEO):**
- "Here is what the book is really doing"
- "This is the pattern that drives the text"
- CTA: Parent outline or course

**Annotation messaging (Social):**
- "Mark this. Now you can see the pattern"
- "Use this color system to track the lens"
- CTA: Annotation download

**Do not mix jobs inside short-form content.**

## 6. Website Alignment (Where Each Track Lives)

**Annotation page (`/annotations/[text]/`):**
- Primary CTA: Download guide
- Secondary CTA: "Show your parent the 10-week plan" → `/<text-slug>/`

**Parent outline (`/[text-slug]/` or `/curriculum/[slug]/`):**
- Primary CTA: Course
- Secondary proof: small "See the annotation method" block → `/annotations/[text]/`

**Course page:**
- Method artifacts strip: Annotation → Worksheet → Essay
- Purpose: make delivery visible, not just claimed

**Homepage:**
- Text grid remains primary
- Add a supporting "Method in action" strip linking to annotations

---

## 7. Production Pipeline (Per Text)

Minimum viable pack per text:

**Track A (Interpretation):**
- 1 guide page
- 1 pattern video (30s)
- 1 parent outline

**Track B (Annotation):**
- 1 annotation guide (preview + download)
- 1 annotation demo video (30s)
- 2-3 social snippets

This creates modular, repeatable production without cross-contamination.

---

## 8. Metrics to Validate Alignment

- Annotation download rate
- Annotation → parent outline CTR
- Parent outline → course CTR
- Course page engagement on method artifacts block
