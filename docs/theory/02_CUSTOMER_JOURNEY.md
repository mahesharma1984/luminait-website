# 02: The Customer Journey

**Purpose:** How parents and students move from search to enrollment — two funnels serving different audiences.

**Sources:** Synthesised from FUNNEL_ARCHITECTURE_v2_0, FRAMEWORK_Credence_Conversion_Touchpoints_v1_2, Distribution_Strategy_Reading_Writing_PLG_v1_0, PMF_Addendum_Reading_Writing_Hierarchy_v1_0

**Prerequisite:** [01_CREDENCE_PROBLEM.md](01_CREDENCE_PROBLEM.md) — why the journey is structured around proof, not persuasion.

## 1. Two Funnels, One Core Strength

Both funnels share the same core: text-specific, reading-first methodology. They differ in audience and path length.

| Dimension | Funnel 1: Analysis Guides | Funnel 2: Parent-Direct |
|-----------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| Audience | Student (VCE/HSC/IB) | Parent (all levels) |
| Entry | Searches for essay help | Searches for tutoring |
| Content need | Full analysis depth | Quality signal |
| Conversion path | Long (bridge to parent) | Short (direct) |

## 2. Funnel 2: Parent-Direct (Primary)

The parent journey is the primary revenue path. It maps to the four credence stages from [01_CREDENCE_PROBLEM.md](01_CREDENCE_PROBLEM.md).

### Journey Stages

```
STAGE 1: TEXT MATCH (no credibility required)
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Parent lands on homepage, sees text grid.
Question: "Do they teach this book?"
Answer: Binary — yes or no.
Asset: Homepage text grid

        ↓

STAGE 2: PREPARATION PROOF (credibility earned)
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Parent clicks text, sees 10-week course outline.
Question: "Have they prepared for THIS book?"
Answer: Week-by-week breakdown mapped to chapters.
Asset: Text-specific course outline (/[text-slug]/)

        ↓

STAGE 3: METHOD CONFIDENCE (credibility confirmed)
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Parent optionally explores generic pages.
Question: "Do they have a real system?"
Answer: Syllabus, sample worksheets, progress reports.
Asset: Generic pedagogy pages (supporting, not required)

        ↓

STAGE 4: ACTION (conversion)
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Parent reaches course page.
Question: "What do I get? How much?"
Answer: Course details, pricing, enrollment.
Asset: Course page (/course/)
```

### The Proof Point Formula

At Stage 2, the text-specific course outline must prove preparation without giving away the product:

- Week-by-week structure with chapter references (shows preparation depth)
- Device/theme focus per week (shows text knowledge)
- One sample output (shows what student produces)
- CTA to enroll

This is the minimum text-specific proof that demonstrates preparation.

## 3. Funnel 1: Analysis Guides (Student-Led)

Full SEO content play for upper secondary students.

```
SEARCH → GUIDE → VALUE DEMO → EMAIL CAPTURE → BRIDGE TO PARENT → CONVERSION

Student searches "[text] themes VCE"
    ↓
Lands on full analysis guide (/vce/[text]/)
    ↓
Consumes Steps 1-4 (open, SEO-indexed)
    ↓
Step 5 gated for email capture
    ↓
Bridge touchpoints: "Showing this to a parent?" / email sequence
    ↓
Parent lands on /course/ via student referral
    ↓
Enrollment
```

**Key difference from Funnel 2:** Student validates quality first. Parent arrives pre-convinced. But the path is longer and requires bridge infrastructure.

---

## 4. Messaging Hierarchy

Both funnels follow the same messaging hierarchy, but with different depth:

```
LEVEL 1: TEXT MATCH (both funnels)
─────────────────────────────────
"We teach [Text]"
Verifiable, binary, no trust required.
This is the entry point.

LEVEL 2: METHODOLOGY VISIBLE (both funnels)
─────────────────────────────────
"Here's how we teach it"
Funnel 1: Full demonstration (Steps 1-5)
Funnel 2: Preview (enough to signal quality)

LEVEL 3: OUTCOMES (post-enrollment)
─────────────────────────────────
"Here's what your child will produce"
Discovered through delivery.
Drives retention and referral.
```

### Messaging Rules

**Lead with reading (acquisition):**
- "Master [Text Name] in 10 weeks"
- "Your child is studying [Text] — we teach it"
- "Text-specific classes for [School]'s English curriculum"

**Don't lead with writing (in acquisition):**
- "Improve your child's writing skills"
- "Learn analytical techniques"
- "Develop critical thinking"

The reading message is concrete, verifiable, and urgent. The writing message is abstract and requires trust not yet earned.

**Referral messaging inverts:** Once trust is established, parents who have experienced the credence value *can* communicate writing outcomes. "My child's essays are so much better now."

---

## 5. Credibility Sequence

The journey is designed so that credibility builds progressively — parents never need to make a trust-leap:

```
STAGE 1: TEXT MATCH (no credibility required)
    "We teach Animal Farm in Term 2"
    └── Verifiable, binary, low friction

STAGE 2: METHODOLOGY VISIBLE (credibility earned)
    "Here's how we teach close reading using TVODE"
    └── Parent sees structure, even if can't evaluate it

STAGE 3: OUTCOMES OBSERVED (credibility confirmed)
    "Here's your child's essay — before and after"
    └── Parent sees improvement, trusts the process

STAGE 4: WRITING VALUE DISCOVERED (credibility transferred)
    "My child writes better across all subjects now"
    └── Credence value realised through experience
```

---

## 6. When the Journey Stalls

Not every parent converts linearly. When friction occurs at the price/commitment stage, the **Validation Loop** (→ [03_VALIDATION_LOOP.md](03_VALIDATION_LOOP.md)) provides a mechanism to recapture hesitant users by spiking motivation with outcome proof.

## 7. Build Priority

| Phase | Focus | Assets |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Phase 1 (done) | Funnel 2 MVP | Homepage text grid, 18 course outlines, course page |
| Phase 2 | Funnel 1 foundation | VCE hub, curriculum hubs, analysis guides |
| Phase 3 | Scale | HSC/IB hubs, email infrastructure, parent bridge |
