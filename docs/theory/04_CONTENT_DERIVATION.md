# 04: Content Derivation

**Purpose:** How to derive marketing messages and content from text kernel analysis — not from generic marketing frameworks.

**Sources:** Synthesised from KDD_Methodology_v2_0, Distribution_Strategy_Reading_Writing_PLG_v1_0

**Prerequisite:** [01_CREDENCE_PROBLEM.md](01_CREDENCE_PROBLEM.md) — the strategy depends on visible text-specific expertise, which must be authentic.

## 1. The Core Principle

> Derive the marketing message from the source material. Don't impose generic marketing onto content.

This parallels literary analysis methodology (CPEA):

```
CPEA (Literary Analysis)          Content Derivation
─────────────────────────         ─────────────────────────────
Code → Pattern → Effect           Kernel → Message → Funnel
   (derive, don't impose)            (derive, don't impose)
```

In literary analysis, you don't decide "this book is about innocence" then find evidence. You code the text, see what patterns emerge, then articulate. In content strategy, you don't decide "social is for agitation" then write agitation content. You explore what the kernel can say, see what messages emerge, then assign channels.

## 2. PLG-PMF Diagnosis

Before deriving content, diagnose distribution readiness. Score three dimensions:

| Dimension | What It Measures | Scale |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| Time to Value (TTV) | How fast users get value | 1 (>1 week) to 5 (<1 min) |
| Demonstrability | Can users see value was delivered | 1 (deferred) to 5 (self-evident) |
| Aha Clarity | How clear is the activation moment | 1 (subjective) to 5 (binary) |

**PLG Score** = Average of three dimensions.

**Applied to this product:**

| Slice | TTV | Demonstrability | Aha Clarity | PLG Score | Route |
|-------|-----|-----------------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| Writing (core) | 2 | 1.5 | 2 | **1.8** | Education funnel |
| Reading (entry) | 4+ | 4 | 4 | **~4.0** | PLG-ready |

**Diagnosis:** High PMF, Low PLG. The product works but can't demonstrate that it works without assistance. Solution: build a PLG-ready entry point (reading) that funnels to the non-PLG core (writing).

## 3. The Derivation Process

### Phase A: Exploration (What can we say?)

1. **Audience mapping:** Who are they, what awareness stage, what pain points?
2. **Message derivation:** For each kernel element, what hook does this generate? For each pain point, how does the kernel address it?
3. **Content drafts:** Exploratory — write draft hooks per channel without constraining yet.

### Phase B: Selection (What should we say?)

4. **Thread selection:** Pick the ONE core message that unifies the funnel. Test: Is it memorable? Differentiating? Pattern-anchored? Funnel-continuous?
5. **Channel assignment:** Given the thread, define each channel's ONE job.
6. **Execution constraints:** Targeting, prioritisation, production specs.

### Phase C: Refinement

7. **Constrained drafts:** Rewrite content with channel constraints applied.

**Key:** Explore before constraining. If you define channel strategy before exploring message options, you might miss the best angle.

## 4. Channel Jobs

Each channel has ONE job. Mixing jobs dilutes effectiveness.

| Channel | Job | Message Type | Asset |
|---------|-----|-------------|-------|
| SEO | Capture text-specific search | Reading-led | Guide pages |
| Social (text) | Drive to entry point | Reading-led hooks | Text insights (posts) |
| **Social (video)** | **Demonstrate expertise at scale** | **Pattern-specific analysis** | **30-sec videos (Funnel 3)** |
| Email | Nurture toward conversion | Method → outcomes | Sequence |
| Consultation | Convert to enrollment | Trust-building | Personal |
| Progress reports | Retain through value | Outcome visibility | Reports |

**Note on social video vs. social text:** These are separate channel jobs. Text-based social posts drive clicks to an entry point (guide page). Video demonstrates expertise directly in the feed — the proof is delivered *before* the click. Video's job is not "drive traffic" but "pre-convince." The click-through that follows carries higher intent because the credence work is already done.

## 5. Message Derivation from Kernel

The kernel (text analysis) is the source of all content:

| Kernel Element | Marketing Use | Example |
|----------------|--------------|---------|
| Pattern name | Hook/headline | "The Dread Engine" (Romeo & Juliet) |
| Core dynamic | Body copy | "Audience receives foreknowledge, watches characters pursue hope toward doom" |
| Device priorities | Feature list | "You'll master dramatic irony, foreshadowing, oxymoron..." |
| Reader effect | Aha preview | "Most stories ask 'What will happen?' This one asks 'How will I watch it happen?'" |
| Chapter alignment | Course structure | "Week 1: Act I — The Prophecy" |

### For Parent-Facing Content

The kernel provides text-specific proof (Journey Stage 2, see [02_CUSTOMER_JOURNEY.md](02_CUSTOMER_JOURNEY.md)):

| Parent Content | Kernel Source |
|----------------|--------------|
| 10-week course outline | Stage 1 (structure) + Stage 4 (device priorities) |
| Theme/device lists | Stage 4 (pattern synthesis) |
| Sample insight | Stage 6 (reasoning document) |
| Overview paragraph | Derived from pattern synthesis |

### For Student-Facing Content

The kernel IS the content (Funnel 1 analysis guides):

| Guide Section | Kernel Source |
|---------------|--------------|
| Hero/Hook | Stage 4 pattern + Stage 6 thesis |
| The Reveal | Stage 4 three-point breakdown |
| Anchor Quote | Stage 5 highest-impact evidence |
| Devices (Top 5) | Stage 4 priorities + Stage 5 evidence |
| Essay Toolkit | Stage 4 + Stage 6 applications |

### For Video Content (Funnel 3)

Each kernel generates multiple 30-second videos. One text = 3-5 pattern-specific videos. The derivation follows the same "derive, don't impose" principle as written content.

| Video Element | Kernel Source | Example (The Outsiders) |
|---------------|--------------|------------------------|
| Hook (opening line) | Pattern name + reader effect | "Hinton doesn't describe Ponyboy. She makes him describe himself." |
| Visual anchor | Stage 5 anchor quote + text page | Page image with highlighted passage |
| Pattern reveal | Stage 4 core dynamic | "Direct characterisation — the narrator reveals character through first-person observation" |
| Device demonstration | Stage 4 device priorities | Annotation overlay showing adjective choices, sentence rhythm |
| CTA | Channel-dependent | Social: "Follow for more" / Service: "Link in bio for the full 10-week course" |

**Video spec derivation process:**

```
Kernel (text analysis)
    ↓
Pattern selection: Pick ONE pattern per video (not the whole kernel)
    ↓
Pedagogical logic: Why does this pattern matter for the student?
    ↓
Visual flow: Book cover → context image → text page → annotation overlay
    ↓
Voiceover script: 30-second narration (analytical, authoritative tone)
    ↓
Scene template: HTML animation synchronised to voiceover
```

**Video types by purpose:**

| Type | Purpose | CTA | Derived From |
|------|---------|-----|-------------|
| Pattern analysis (social) | Demonstrate expertise in feed | Follow / See more | Stage 4 pattern + Stage 5 evidence |
| Annotation method | Show teaching technique | "Try this with your text" | Stage 5 evidence + TVODE method |
| Service-focused | Drive enrollment | "Link to 10-week course" | Stage 4 pattern + course outline |

**Scale implication:** 18 texts × 3-5 patterns each = 54-90+ unique videos from existing kernel material. This volume creates consistent social posting for months without generating new source analysis.

## 6. Content Strategy: The Strategic Sequence

```
VIDEO catches attention → READING pulls them in → METHODOLOGY builds trust → WRITING keeps them there
```

Applied to assets:

| Asset Type | Lead With | Support With | CTA To |
|------------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Video (social)** | **Pattern-specific insight (30 sec)** | **Visible analysis method** | **Guide page / Course outline** |
| SEO / Guides | Text-specific insight | Method visibility | Diagnostic / Download |
| Social (text) | Text hooks | Method demos | Guide page |
| Flyers | Text list | Method mention | Guide QR |
| Landing page | Method + outcomes | Credibility | Enrollment |
| Progress reports | Outcomes observed | Next term preview | Retention |

Video sits upstream of SEO in the sequence. Where SEO captures existing intent ("I need help with The Outsiders"), video *creates* intent ("I didn't know someone could teach The Outsiders like this"). This is the difference between demand capture and demand generation.

## 7. Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails |
|-------------|-------------|
| Leading with "improve writing" | Credence claim — unverifiable, requires trust not earned |
| Generic marketing copy | Doesn't leverage text-specific advantage |
| Imposing message frameworks | Misses kernel-derived angles that are authentically differentiated |
| Mixing channel jobs | Dilutes effectiveness — each channel does ONE thing |
| Giving away full analysis | Removes incentive to enroll |
| Making videos about "our method" generically | Same credence trap as written copy — must be text-specific |
| Cramming multiple patterns into one video | One video = one pattern. Volume comes from more videos, not longer ones |
