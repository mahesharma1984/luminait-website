# 01: The Credence Problem

**Purpose:** Why education is hard to sell — and how text-specificity sidesteps the trap.

## 1. Education Is a Credence Good

Consumer behaviour research classifies goods by when quality can be evaluated (Darby & Karni, 1973):

| Type | Evaluation | Examples |
|------|------------|----------|
| Search | Before purchase | Clothing, furniture |
| Experience | After purchase | Restaurants, movies |
| Credence | Never fully evaluable | Medical care, legal advice, **education** |

**Tutoring is a credence good.** Parents cannot evaluate quality before buying (they lack pedagogical expertise), and they cannot fully evaluate it after (they can't assess whether the pedagogy was optimal).

Credence goods rely on prestige markers — degrees, school affiliations, brand recognition — because consumers cannot judge quality directly. This creates the **credibility trap**: parents buy based on reputation, not pedagogy.

## 2. The Credibility Trap

Traditional tutoring sells on credentials:

- University degree
- School affiliation
- Years of experience
- Brand recognition

If you lack these, competing on credibility directly fails. But the tutoring market is dominated by generic "English skills" providers — no provider systematically builds classes around prescribed texts. The differentiation opportunity exists, but the credibility barrier blocks it.

## 3. The Sidestep: Text-Specificity Creates a Search Attribute

Text-specific tutoring attaches a **search attribute** to a credence good. The parent can verify before purchase:

- Does this tutor teach the book my child is studying? **Yes/No**
- Is there a class running for this text this term? **Yes/No**
- Do the materials cover the chapters being assessed? **Yes/No**

These are binary, verifiable questions. The parent does not need pedagogical expertise to answer them. This converts part of the credence purchase into a search-like evaluation.

### Reading vs. Writing: The SEC Split

| Dimension | Reading (text-specific) | Writing |
|-----------|------------------------|---------|
| SEC type | Search attribute (verifiable) | Pure credence (unverifiable) |
| Parent evaluation | "Do they teach [Text]?" — Yes/No | "Is my child a better writer?" — Can't judge |
| Purchase friction | Low | High |
| Funnel role | Entry mechanism | Retention mechanism |

**Core principle:** Lead with what they can verify (reading). Deliver what they can't evaluate (writing). Let experience do the selling.

## 4. The Proof Point Hierarchy

Not all proof is equal. Moving up this hierarchy increases conversion:

```
WEAKEST
    │
    ├── "We teach English" (generic claim)
    ├── "We have a methodology" (generic proof)
    ├── "We teach The Giver" (specific claim, no proof)
    ├── "Here's our 10-week method" (generic proof of capability)
    ├── "Here's our 10-week plan FOR The Giver" (specific proof) ← TARGET
    ├── "Watch us analyze The Giver in 30 seconds" (specific demonstration) ← VIDEO
    ├── "Here's the booklist for McKinnon SC" (school-specific proof)
    ├── "Here's a worksheet FROM The Giver" (specific artifact)
    ├── "Here's student work ON The Giver" (specific outcome)
    │
STRONGEST
```

The goal: move from generic proof to text-specific proof without giving away the product.

### Video as Credence-to-Experience Conversion

Video occupies a unique position in the hierarchy. Written proof (course outlines, guides) asks the parent to *trust* preparation. Video converts that credence moment into something closer to an **experience attribute** — the parent can directly observe the methodology in action.

A 30-second analysis video demonstrates:
- **Text knowledge** — the tutor clearly knows this book
- **Analytical depth** — the insight is non-obvious, specific
- **Teaching method** — TVODE structure visible in how the analysis unfolds

This is stronger than a course outline (which proves preparation but not ability) and weaker than student work samples (which prove outcomes). But critically, video requires **zero trust and zero effort** from the parent — they don't need to read a page or evaluate a document. They just watch.

This matters because the credibility bypass mechanism (§5) depends on substituting visible methodology for traditional credentials. Video makes methodology visible in the lowest-friction format possible.

## 5. The Credibility Bypass Mechanism

Instead of proving credibility, reduce the need for it:

| Traditional Credibility | Substitute | How It Works |
|------------------------|------------|--------------|
| Degree/qualification | Visible methodology | TVODE structure shown in guides |
| Degree/qualification | **Video demonstration** | 30-sec analysis proves competence visually |
| School reputation | Text-specific match | "We teach [Text]" = search attribute |
| Years of experience | Before/after samples | Student work demonstrates outcomes |
| Testimonials | Progress reports | Parent observes improvement directly |

The reading entry point sidesteps credibility. Parent doesn't need to trust your pedagogy — they only need to verify you teach the right book. Once enrolled, methodology becomes visible through delivery.

Video accelerates this bypass. Where a course outline requires the parent to click through, read, and evaluate, a social video delivers the credibility substitute *before the parent even visits the site*. The methodology becomes visible at the point of discovery, not the point of evaluation.

## 6. Implications

This analysis drives everything downstream:

- **Customer Journey** (→ [02_CUSTOMER_JOURNEY.md](02_CUSTOMER_JOURNEY.md)): The journey stages are designed around progressively converting credence into quasi-experience.
- **Validation Loop** (→ [03_VALIDATION_LOOP.md](03_VALIDATION_LOOP.md)): When price friction spikes, the mechanism injects outcome proof to compensate.
- **Content Derivation** (→ [04_CONTENT_DERIVATION.md](04_CONTENT_DERIVATION.md)): Messaging must be derived from the text kernel, not imposed from generic marketing — because the entire strategy depends on visible text-specific expertise.
