# 00: The Commercial Thesis

**Purpose:** Upstream document that frames B2B cohort-build partnerships as the primary commercial strategy. Everything else — parent-facing assets, PLG, content — is subordinate to this sale.

**Status:** Active — canonical
**Date:** February 19, 2026
**Version:** 1.0

**Prerequisite:** [01_CREDENCE_PROBLEM.md](01_CREDENCE_PROBLEM.md) — the credence bypass applies to partners too.

**Sources:** Extracted and corrected from `presentations/scaling/`, `presentations/partnership/`, `presentations/appendix/`, `docs/P_GTM_Partner_Unit_Economics_v1_0.md`

## 1. Core Commercial Claim

We design, launch, stabilise, and hand over a single high-quality text-anchored cohort capable of generating ~$18–20k in revenue across its lifecycle.

That is the entire anchor. Everything on the site supports that.

---

## 2. Cohort Economics Proof

### Baseline Cohort Model

* 10 students
* $600 per student per term
* 3-term lifecycle

= ~$18,000 total cohort lifecycle revenue

### How the Revenue Actually Develops

A cohort launched from zero enrolments builds progressively.

**Phase 1 — Ramp (Term 1)**

* Enrolments build
* Instruction stabilises
* Revenue accumulates as class fills

**Phase 2 — Stabilisation (Term 2)**

* Cohort reaches viable size
* Retention becomes visible
* Revenue becomes predictable

**Phase 3 — Steady State (Term 3+)**

* Full lifecycle value realised (~$18–20k)
* Artefacts reused
* Marginal cost declines
* Replication becomes possible across additional texts

### What This Means Commercially

* Revenue per cohort: ~$18–20k over lifecycle
* Time to stabilisation: 1–2 terms
* Engagement builds a revenue-producing asset
* Expansion occurs text-by-text through disciplined replication

Show the math clearly. Show the ramp visually. Avoid presenting it as immediate cash.

## 3. The Unit of Scale

The text-anchored cohort is the smallest unit supporting stable teaching quality in secondary English.

**Constraints (non-negotiable):**

* Students must share the same text
* Students must be at the same year level
* Ability bands must be compatible
* Evidence and progression must be internally coherent

**Why this matters commercially:**

* Scale is discrete (number of viable cohorts), not elastic (stuffing more students in)
* Artefacts are reusable across cohort instances of the same text
* Measurement remains comparable across cohorts
* Marginal cost of a new cohort on an existing text is low
* Scale happens by repeating the structure, not simplifying learning conditions

**Growth pattern:**

| Phase | Structure | Revenue Base |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Single cohort (baseline) | 10 students, 3 terms | ~$18k |
| Phase 1 proof | 2–3 active cohorts | $36k–$54k |
| 12–18 months | 4–6 active cohorts across year levels | $90k–$110k+ |

Revenue compounds through cohort persistence and replication, not aggregation.

## 4. The B2B Engagement Structure

### What We Deliver

1. Design one viable text-anchored cohort
2. Deliver Term 1 directly (founder-led calibration)
3. Stabilise progression and retention
4. Train teachers during Term 2
5. Hand over delivery framework
6. Continue materials licensing

### What the Partner Provides

* Existing lead flow
* Operations (space, scheduling, admin)
* Teachers (trained by LuminAIT)

### Commercial Structure

* ~$20k engagement fee
* Target outcome: stable $18–20k cohort
* Ongoing: artefact licensing and cohort replication

### What Makes It Bounded

* Minimum lead thresholds defined upfront
* Clear success/failure conditions
* If economics don't move during Phase 1: engagement ends cleanly
* Partner retains 100% upside post-implementation
* No ongoing royalties. No lock-in.

## 5. The Subordination Hierarchy

Everything on the site serves the B2B sale. The B2B messaging itself is constrained to the B2B page. But the rest of the site reinforces it by showcasing the infrastructure assets that the partner will receive.

```
B2B SALE (primary)
│   "We build you a revenue-producing cohort"
│
├── PROOF LAYER 1: Instructional Infrastructure
│   Annotation guides, TVODE worksheets, measurement gates
│   → Demonstrates WHAT the partner gets
│   → Lives at: /annotations/, curriculum templates, progress page
│
├── PROOF LAYER 2: Parent-Facing Assets
│   Curriculum guides, school pages, progress reports
│   → Demonstrates HOW parents perceive value (retention driver)
│   → Lives at: /[text-slug]/, /curriculum/, /schools/, /progress/
│
├── PROOF LAYER 3: PLG / Student Entry
│   Annotation guide downloads, student SEO
│   → Demonstrates DEMAND signal (students already seeking this)
│   → Lives at: /annotations/[text]/
│
└── PROOF LAYER 4: Outcomes
    Before/after writing, conversion/retention data, founder-led results
    → Demonstrates THAT it works
    → Lives at: /results/
```

### How the Layers Reinforce the Sale

**To the B2B buyer visiting the partnership page:**

* "Look at what your teachers will deliver" → Proof Layer 1
* "Look at what parents will see" → Proof Layer 2
* "Look at the demand that already exists" → Proof Layer 3
* "Look at what happened when we ran this ourselves" → Proof Layer 4

**To the parent (unchanged experience):**

The parent journey remains intact. Parents don't see B2B messaging. They see text-specific proof → preparation confidence → course → enrollment. Their positive experience is itself a proof asset for the B2B sale.

**To the student (unchanged experience):**

Students find annotation guides via SEO/social, download them, and optionally bridge to the parent funnel. Their organic demand validates the B2B claim that the infrastructure produces discoverable, usable assets.

## 6. What a Revenue Partner Needs to See

They need confidence in:

1. **Clear revenue per cohort** — the $18–20k lifecycle model, shown honestly with ramp
2. **Defined stabilisation period** — 1–2 terms, not instant
3. **Repeatable process** — same infrastructure applied text-by-text
4. **Documented instructional control** — the system works without the founder
5. **Evidence of real outcomes** — conversion, retention, and learning data from founder-led cohorts

The existing site assets already support this. The task is organising them around the single cohort-build thesis and making them legible to the B2B buyer from a single page.

## 7. Relationship to Existing Theory

This document does not replace the theory chain (01–05). It reframes their role:

| Theory Doc | Original Role | Role Under B2B Thesis |
|---|---|---|
| 01 Credence Problem | Why parents can't evaluate quality | Also why partners can't — the credence bypass serves both audiences |
| 02 Customer Journey | Primary revenue path (parent-direct) | Proof Layer 2 — demonstrates how parents experience value |
| 03 Validation Loop | Rescue mechanism for price friction | Retention mechanism that partners inherit |
| 04 Content Derivation | How content is extracted from pedagogy | How infrastructure assets are derived (not invented) |
| 05 Channel Alignment | Interpretation vs annotation job split | How PLG (annotation track) serves Proof Layer 3 without contaminating credence track |

The theory docs describe real mechanisms. This document describes the commercial frame in which those mechanisms produce a sellable engagement.

## 8. What This Is Not

**Not consulting.** This is operational deployment with measured outcomes.

**Not content licensing.** The curriculum is tied to training, QA, and measurement — not sold as standalone material.

**Not a platform.** No software rollout. No EdTech dashboard. Infrastructure is artefacts + process + measurement.

**Not speculative.** Engagement is bounded. Failure conditions are defined upfront. If economics don't move, it ends.
