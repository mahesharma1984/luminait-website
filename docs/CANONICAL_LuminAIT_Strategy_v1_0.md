# CANONICAL STRATEGY OVERVIEW - LuminAIT

Version: 2.0
Date: February 19, 2026
Status: Active - canonical summary
Purpose: Single, comprehensive document that captures the full system, strategy, and execution model.

This document consolidates all active work into one coherent narrative. It does not replace deep references; it points to them for implementation detail.

**Key change (v2.0):** B2B cohort-build partnership is the primary commercial strategy. Parent-direct and PLG are subordinate proof layers that reinforce the B2B sale. See `docs/theory/00_COMMERCIAL_THESIS.md` for the full thesis.

## 1. Core Thesis

LuminAIT is a text-specific English tutoring infrastructure. Education is a credence good: neither parents nor partners can verify quality before or after purchase. The strategic solution is to make quality visible through text-specific proof, engineered pedagogy, and measurement.

When teaching quality is systematised and instrumented, it becomes transferable and produces predictable changes in unit economics (conversion, retention, ARPU, and margins). This causal chain is the basis for bounded B2B partnerships where partners pay for measured economic movement, not promises.

**The commercial anchor:** We design, launch, stabilise, and hand over a single text-anchored cohort capable of generating ~$18–20k in revenue across its lifecycle. Everything on the site supports this claim.

---

## 2. Commercial Strategy (B2B Primary)

### 2.1 The B2B Engagement

A cohort-build partnership. LuminAIT provides the instructional infrastructure; the partner provides leads, operations, and teachers.

**Engagement structure:**

1. Design one viable text-anchored cohort
2. Deliver Term 1 directly (founder-led)
3. Stabilise progression and retention
4. Train partner teachers during Term 2
5. Hand over delivery framework
6. Continue materials licensing

**Cohort economics:**

* 10 students × $600/student × 3-term lifecycle = ~$18k
* Revenue ramps progressively (not instant)
* Stabilisation: 1–2 terms
* Expansion: text-by-text replication

### 2.2 The Proof Hierarchy

The site reinforces the B2B sale through four proof layers. B2B messaging is constrained to the partnership page; the rest of the site demonstrates the infrastructure.

| Layer | What It Proves | Site Assets |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| 1. Instructional Infrastructure | What the partner gets | Annotation guides, worksheets, measurement gates |
| 2. Parent-Facing Assets | How parents perceive value | Curriculum guides, school pages, progress reports |
| 3. PLG / Student Entry | That demand exists | Annotation downloads, student SEO traffic |
| 4. Outcomes | That it works | Before/after writing, conversion/retention data |

### 2.3 Two Audiences, One Site

* **B2B buyer:** Sees the partnership page, then explores infrastructure assets. Never sees parent-voice messaging as the primary frame.
* **Parent:** Unchanged journey — text match → preparation proof → method confidence → enrollment. Their positive experience is itself a proof asset.
* **Student:** Finds annotation guides via SEO/social, downloads them. Organic demand validates infrastructure value.

## 3. Market Reality and Positioning

### 3.1 The Credence Problem

Parents cannot judge pedagogy. Partners cannot judge pedagogy either. Generic tutoring relies on credentials and reputation signals, creating a credibility trap for new entrants.

→ Full detail: `docs/theory/01_CREDENCE_PROBLEM.md`

### 3.2 The Text-Specific Bypass

Text specificity creates a search attribute inside a credence good. Both parents and partners can verify: Do you teach this exact book? Is the plan mapped to chapters? Is there a measurement framework?

### 3.3 Reading vs Writing Hierarchy

* Reading (text match) is the acquisition lever — for both parent and B2B sales.
* Writing improvement is the retention lever — measured outcomes prove the system works.
* Lead with what can be verified; let writing value be discovered through delivery.

---

## 4. Pedagogical System (Scientific + Relational)

### 4.1 Scientific Pedagogy

* Explicit instruction
* Cognitive load sequencing
* Retrieval practice
* Worked examples and scaffolding
* Kernel method: treat the text as data, derive patterns, then build delivery

### 4.2 Relational Pedagogy

* School-context specificity
* Assessment awareness
* Confidence-building through visible structure

### 4.3 Transferability

The system is designed to be teachable by others. This is the commercial requirement — the B2B engagement depends on removing founder dependency and enabling controlled replication through training and QA gates.

→ Full detail: `docs/FRAMEWORK_Scientific_Relational_Pedagogy_v1_0.md`

---

## 5. Measurement Layer (The Keystone)

Measurement makes quality legible, comparable, and enforceable. Without it, quality claims remain credence-based and cannot drive economics.

Instrumentation includes:

* Diagnostics at entry
* Progression tracking across core skills
* Outcome visibility for parents (retention driver) and partners (economic signal)

Measurement converts pedagogical quality into an economic signal, enabling outcome-based commercial terms. This is what makes the B2B engagement bounded rather than speculative.

---

## 6. Funnel Architecture

### 6.1 Primary: B2B Partnership Funnel

```
Partnership page → Infrastructure showcase → Engagement proposal
```

The B2B buyer sees:

1. The cohort economics model
2. The instructional infrastructure (annotation guides, measurement, artefacts)
3. The parent experience (as proof of retention/value perception)
4. Outcome data (as proof the system works)

→ Full detail: `docs/technical/FUNNEL_STRATEGY.md`

### 6.2 Proof Layer: Parent-Direct Funnel

```
Homepage (text selection) → Text-specific outline → Course → Enrollment
```

This is the parent journey that the B2B partner will inherit. It demonstrates how parents experience value.

**Secondary entry points:**

* Schools page → Text guide → Course
* Video demo → Text guide → Course

→ Full detail: `docs/theory/02_CUSTOMER_JOURNEY.md`

### 6.3 Proof Layer: PLG / Annotation Funnel

```
Student SEO → Annotation preview → Download gate → Parent bridge
```

Demonstrates organic demand for the infrastructure.

### 6.4 Proof Layer: Video-to-Parent (Social Discovery)

```
Social video → Depth layer → Text match → Enrollment
```

Demonstrates reach and credence bypass at first contact.

### 6.5 Credibility Sequence (Parent Journey)

1. Text Match (binary — verifiable)
2. Preparation Proof (text-specific outlines)
3. Method Confidence (generic pedagogy pages)
4. Outcomes Observed (progress/results)

### 6.6 Validation Loop

When price friction occurs, inject outcome proof to spike motivation and loop users back to conversion.

→ Full detail: `docs/theory/03_VALIDATION_LOOP.md`

---

## 7. Content System and Channel Alignment

### 7.1 Kernel-Derived Distribution

Content is derived from the text kernel, not imposed marketing frameworks.

→ Full detail: `docs/theory/04_CONTENT_DERIVATION.md`

### 7.2 Two Tracks, One Kernel

* Interpretation / Pattern track (credence) for SEO and parent proof → Proof Layer 2
* Annotation method track (action) for social and student entry → Proof Layer 3

### 7.3 Channel Jobs (One Job Per Asset)

| Channel | Job | B2B Proof Layer |
|---------|-----|-----------------|
| SEO (text-specific) | Capture intent + build credence | Layer 2 (parent assets) |
| Local SEO (school) | Capture school intent | Layer 2 (parent assets) |
| Social video | Demonstrate expertise in-feed | Layer 1 (infrastructure showcase) |
| Annotation pages | Low-friction action + method visibility | Layer 3 (PLG / demand signal) |
| Parent outline | Preparation proof | Layer 2 (parent assets) |
| Course page | Conversion proof | Layer 2 (parent assets) |
| Results/Progress | Validation loop | Layer 4 (outcomes) |
| B2B partnership page | Cohort economics + infrastructure | Primary B2B surface |

→ Full detail: `docs/theory/05_CHANNEL_ALIGNMENT.md`, `docs/technical/CONTENT_MAP.md`

## 8. Local SEO and School Strategy

School-specific proof is the strongest verifiable signal after outcomes. It serves both parents (local trust) and B2B partners (demonstrates school-level integration capability).

Implementation:

* School landing pages with verified booklists
* LocalBusiness schema
* Internal linking between schools and text outlines
* Annual verification cycle and updates

→ Full detail: `docs/technical/LOCAL_SEO_STRATEGY.md`

---

## 9. Partnership and Distributed Delivery Strategy

### 9.1 P-GTM Framework

Partnerships are selected via Gap → Container → Exchange gates, then scored for alignment and sequenced by proof requirements.

→ Full detail: `docs/P_GTM_Partnership_v3_0.md`

### 9.2 Partner Proof Layer

Partners need integration proof, not just parent-facing proof. Required assets:

* Partner hub page (B2B surface on the site)
* Partner pack (operational + economic clarity)
* Proof-of-transfer (partner-taught outcomes)

→ Full detail: `docs/technical/PARTNER_PROOF_LAYER.md`

### 9.3 Graduate Network Model

* Capital arbitrage: LuminAIT IP vs local school trust
* Graduated hourly model aligns incentives
* Quality gates enforce methodology fidelity

→ Full detail: `docs/P_GTM_Graduate_Network_v1_0.md`

---

## 10. Unit Economics Causal Chain

Mechanistic links (not correlations):

* Better outcomes → higher perceived value
* Higher perceived value → higher conversion
* Progress visibility → higher retention
* Trust → ARPU expansion
* Teacher leverage → margin expansion

These links are measurable and form the basis for outcome-based commercial terms and bounded pilots.

→ Full detail: `docs/P_GTM_Partner_Unit_Economics_v1_0.md`

---

## 11. Operations and Build System

### 11.1 Source of Truth

* Templates in src/templates
* Partials in src/partials
* Config in site-config.json
* Data in /data (parent guides, video scenes, schools, annotation guides)

Never edit root HTML files directly. Always rebuild from templates.

### 11.2 Build Scripts

* build.js (main pages)
* build-parent-guides.js (curriculum guides)
* build-homepage-guides.js (homepage books)
* build-video-scenes.js (studio scenes)
* build-school-pages.js (school pages)
* build-annotation-guides.js (annotation guides)

### 11.3 Design System

* base.css tokens
* page-components.css shared patterns
* page-marketing.css page-level styles
* minimal inline overrides only

→ Full detail: `docs/technical/BUILD_SYSTEM.md`, `docs/technical/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`

## 12. Governance and Quality Control

### 12.1 R/P Split

Reasoning tasks go to the LLM. Precision tasks go to code. This prevents hallucinated precision in production workflows.

### 12.2 Measure-First Protocol

Before destructive builds or major refactors, measure current state, compare templates to output, and preserve deltas.

### 12.3 RALPH Gate

Automation is only used after exploration is complete and validation is programmable.
