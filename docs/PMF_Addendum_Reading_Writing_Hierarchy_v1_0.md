# PMF Addendum: Reading-Writing Hierarchy in the Customer Funnel

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2026  
**Follows:** PMF Framework v1.0 (Text-Specific Secondary English Tutoring)  
**Purpose:** Establish the strategic relationship between reading and writing in customer acquisition and retention

---

## 1. THE CORE INSIGHT

Reading and writing serve different functions in the funnel. They share underlying methodology (TVODE), but occupy different positions in customer behaviour.

```
READING                              WRITING
───────                              ───────
Entry mechanism                      Retention mechanism
Verifiable before purchase           Unverifiable even after purchase
Pulls them in                        Keeps them there
```

**The mistake:** Treating reading and writing as equivalent selling points. They are not. Reading has a structural advantage in acquisition; writing has a structural advantage in retention.

## 2. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

### 2.1 SEC Classification (Search, Experience, Credence)

Consumer behaviour research classifies goods by when quality can be evaluated:

| Type | Evaluation | Examples |
|------|------------|----------|
| Search | Before purchase | Clothing, furniture |
| Experience | After purchase | Restaurants, movies |
| Credence | Never fully evaluable | Medical care, legal advice, education |

**Tutoring is a credence good.** Parents cannot evaluate quality before buying (they lack expertise), and they cannot fully evaluate it after (they can't assess whether the pedagogy was optimal).

Credence goods rely on prestige markers and expert rankings because consumers cannot judge quality directly. This creates the "credibility trap" — parents buy based on reputation, not pedagogy.

### 2.2 Jobs To Be Done (Functional, Emotional, Social)

JTBD theory identifies three layers of customer motivation:

| Job Type | Definition | Tutoring Example |
|----------|------------|------------------|
| Functional | Task to accomplish | "Help my kid understand this book" |
| Emotional | How they want to feel | "Feel like I'm solving this problem" |
| Social | How they want to be perceived | "Be seen as a good parent who invests" |

**The functional job defines the market.** Emotional and social jobs influence purchase, but if the product fails the functional job, customers leave.

## 3. READING VS WRITING: THE SPLIT

### 3.1 Classification

| Dimension | Reading (text-specific) | Writing |
|-----------|------------------------|---------|
| SEC type | Search attribute + Credence | Pure credence |
| Functional job | "Help my kid understand THIS book" | "Make my kid a better writer" |
| Verifiability | High | None |
| Parent evaluation | Can confirm text match instantly | Cannot judge quality even with reports |
| Purchase friction | Low | High |

### 3.2 Why Reading Has a Search Attribute

Text-specific tutoring attaches a **search attribute** to a credence good. The parent can verify before purchase:

- Does this tutor teach the book my child is studying? **Yes/No**
- Is there a class running for this text this term? **Yes/No**
- Do the materials cover the chapters being assessed? **Yes/No**

These are binary, verifiable questions. The parent does not need pedagogical expertise to answer them. This converts part of the credence purchase into a search-like evaluation.

### 3.3 Why Writing Remains Pure Credence

Writing improvement cannot be verified by the parent:

- "Is this essay better?" — Parent lacks expertise to judge
- "Was the feedback useful?" — Parent cannot evaluate pedagogical quality
- "Is my child now a good writer?" — No objective benchmark available

Even progress reports (before/after samples, rubric scores) require interpretation the parent cannot provide. They must trust the tutor's framework.

## 4. FUNNEL IMPLICATIONS

### 4.1 The Logic Chain

```
READING (Search Attribute)
    │
    ├── Parent need: "My child must study [Text]"
    ├── Parent verification: "Do they teach [Text]? Yes."
    ├── Purchase barrier: LOW (no expertise required)
    │
    └── ENTRY DECISION: Proceed
            │
            ▼
EXPERIENCE PHASE
    │
    ├── Parent observes: class delivery, materials, progress reports
    ├── Credence → quasi-experience via methodology visibility
    ├── TVODE becomes tangible through student work
    │
    └── TRUST BUILDING: Pedagogy becomes credible through use
            │
            ▼
WRITING (Credence Discovery)
    │
    ├── Parent notices: essays improved, reasoning sharper
    ├── Cannot fully evaluate WHY, but sees outcomes
    ├── Social job activated: "My child is articulate"
    │
    └── RETENTION + REFERRAL: Value exceeds original purchase
```

### 4.2 Acquisition vs Retention

| Funnel Stage | Primary Lever | Secondary Lever |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Awareness | Text match (reading) | — |
| Consideration | Text match + methodology visibility | Writing outcomes mentioned |
| Purchase | Text match resolves uncertainty | — |
| Retention | Writing improvement discovered | Text continues next term |
| Referral | Writing outcomes communicated | Text match enables word-of-mouth |

**Key insight:** Reading pulls them in (low friction, verifiable). Writing keeps them there (high value, discovered through experience).

## 5. CREDIBILITY STRATEGY

### 5.1 The Credibility Trap

Traditional education sells on credentials:
- University degree
- School affiliation
- Years of experience
- Brand recognition

You lack these. Competing on credibility directly fails.

### 5.2 The Bypass: Search Attribute + Methodology Visibility

Instead of proving credibility, reduce the need for it:

| Traditional Credibility | Your Substitute |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| Degree/qualification | Visible methodology (TVODE structure) |
| School reputation | Text-specific match (search attribute) |
| Years of experience | Before/after student work samples |
| Testimonials | Progress reports parent can see |

**The reading entry point sidesteps credibility.** Parent doesn't need to trust your pedagogy — they only need to verify you teach the right book.

Once enrolled, methodology becomes visible through delivery. The credence good converts to quasi-experience through observation.

### 5.3 Credibility Sequence

```
STAGE 1: TEXT MATCH (no credibility required)
    "We teach Animal Farm in Term 2"
    └── Verifiable, binary, low friction

STAGE 2: METHODOLOGY VISIBLE (credibility earned)
    "Here's how we teach close reading using TVODE"
    └── Parent sees structure, even if can't evaluate it

STAGE 3: OUTCOMES OBSERVED (credibility confirmed)
    "Here's your child's essay — before and after"
    └── Parent sees improvement, trusts the process

STAGE 4: WRITING VALUE DISCOVERED (credibility transferred)
    "My child writes better across all subjects now"
    └── Credence value realised through experience
```

## 6. MESSAGING IMPLICATIONS

### 6.1 Lead with Reading

**Do:**
- "Master [Text Name] in 10 weeks"
- "Your child is studying [Text] — we teach it"
- "Text-specific classes for [School]'s English curriculum"

**Don't:**
- "Improve your child's writing skills"
- "Learn analytical techniques"
- "Develop critical thinking"

The reading message is concrete, verifiable, and urgent. The writing message is abstract and requires trust you haven't earned yet.

### 6.2 Reveal Writing Through Delivery

Writing improvement is communicated after enrolment, not before:

- Progress reports showing essay development
- TVODE feedback demonstrating reasoning improvement
- Parent observation of homework quality

The parent discovers writing value — they don't buy it upfront.

### 6.3 Referral Messaging Inverts

Once trust is established, referral messaging can lead with writing:

- "My child's essays are so much better now"
- "They actually understand how to argue a point"
- "The skills transfer to other subjects"

Referral comes from parents who have experienced the credence value. They can communicate it because they've seen it.

## 7. FUNNEL ARCHITECTURE

### 7.1 Entry Points (Reading-Led)

| Touchpoint | Message | Verification |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| Landing page | "We teach [Text]" | Book list visible |
| Search/SEO | "[Text] tutoring Melbourne" | Instant match |
| Referral | "They teach the exact book" | Named text |

### 7.2 Conversion Mechanism

| Stage | Parent Question | Answer |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| Awareness | "Do they teach the book?" | Yes (search attribute) |
| Interest | "Is there a method?" | Yes (methodology visible) |
| Decision | "Will it work for my child?" | Trial/consultation reduces risk |
| Purchase | "Is it worth the cost?" | Text-specific value > generic tutoring |

### 7.3 Retention Mechanism (Writing-Led)

| Trigger | Parent Experience | Outcome |
|---------|-------------------|---------|
| Week 3-4 | Sees first essay improvement | Trust increases |
| Mid-term | Progress report with before/after | Value confirmed |
| End of term | Essay quality visibly better | Retention for next term |
| Cross-subject | Skills transfer observed | Referral activated |

---

## 8. SUMMARY

**Reading and writing are not equivalent selling points.**

- Reading has a search attribute: verifiable, low friction, entry mechanism
- Writing is pure credence: unverifiable, high value, retention mechanism

**Funnel design follows this hierarchy:**

1. Lead with reading (text match) to bypass credibility trap
2. Build credibility through visible methodology during delivery
3. Let writing value be discovered through experience
4. Referral messaging can then lead with writing outcomes

**The strategic sequence:**

```
READING pulls them in → METHODOLOGY builds trust → WRITING keeps them there
```

## 9. INTEGRATION WITH PMF FRAMEWORK

This addendum extends PMF Framework v1.0:

| PMF Element | Reading Role | Writing Role |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| Market definition | Text-specific demand | Generalised skill demand |
| Problem | "Doesn't understand the book" | "Can't write analytically" |
| Solution | Cohort classes by text | TVODE methodology |
| Fit | Entry point (verifiable) | Retention driver (discovered) |

The PMF holds because reading provides low-friction entry into a market where writing delivers long-term value.
