# Video Content Plan: The Outsiders (Week 3 Alignment)

**Goal**: Align video content strictly with **Week 3: Analysing Key Techniques** of the Parent Curriculum.
**Source**: `/curriculum/the-outsiders/` (Week 3) & `teacher_the-outsiders_relational.html`.
**Structure**: Ordered by Narrative Arc (Exposition → Rising Action → Climax).

---

## 1. Exposition: First-Person Narration
*   **Curriculum Alignment**: Week 3, Technique 1.
*   **Narrative Section**: Exposition (Chapter 1).
*   **Theme**: Dual Consciousness (The "Then" vs. The "Now").
*   **Device**: First-Person Narration.
*   **Quote**: *"I had only two things on my mind: Paul Newman and a ride home."*
*   **Pattern Effect**: Establishes the gap between the experiencing boy (worried about looks/safety) and the retrospective narrator (who knows the story).
*   **Simple Truth**: "The gap between the scared kid living it and the safe man remembering it."

## 2. Rising Action: Flashback
*   **Curriculum Alignment**: Week 3, Technique 3.
*   **Narrative Section**: Rising Action (Chapter 2 - Johnny's Beating).
*   **Theme**: Relational Trauma (The Intrusion of the Past).
*   **Device**: Flashback.
*   **Quote**: *"It was almost four months ago... I don't like to think about it either."*
*   **Pattern Effect**: Demonstrates the difficulty of processing trauma; the past intrudes on the present narrative.
*   **Simple Truth**: "A flashback isn't a memory you invite in. It's a ghost that kicks down the door."

---

## 3. Climax: Internal Monologue
*   **Curriculum Alignment**: Week 3, Technique 2.
*   **Narrative Section**: Climax (Chapter 7 - The Church Fire).
*   **Theme**: Trauma & Dissociation.
*   **Device**: Internal Monologue.
*   **Quote**: *"'The fuzz,' I thought dully."*
*   **Pattern Effect**: Contrasts raw, fragmented immediate thoughts with the coherent narration of the event.
*   **Simple Truth**: "Panic is loud. Trauma is silent. 'Dully' is the sound of shock."

## Script Structure (Standardized)
1.  **Intro**: Introduce Book + Context.
2.  **Narration**: Read the full text passage (User Voice).
3.  **Analysis**: Deconstruct specific quotes/words (Simple Truth).
4.  **Conclusion**: Summarize Pattern + CTA ("We cover this in Week 3").
