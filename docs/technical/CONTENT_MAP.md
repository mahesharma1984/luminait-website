## Channel → Job → Best Content → CTA

| Channel | Job | Best Content | Primary CTA | Source (Kernel) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **SEO (text-specific)** | Capture intent + build credence | Interpretation/pattern guide page | Parent outline (`/[text]`) | Pattern name, core dynamic, anchor quote |
| **Local SEO (school)** | Capture school intent | School page + booklist + links | Text outline (`/[text]`) | Text list + outline |
| **Social video** | Demonstrate expertise in-feed | 30s pattern reveal OR 30s annotation demo (one job per video) | Annotation preview or guide page | Pattern + evidence OR lens + device evidence |
| **Social text/images** | Drive clicks | Annotated snippet + 1 line takeaway | Annotation preview (`/annotations/[text]/`) | Device evidence + lens |
| **Annotation pages** | Low-friction action + method visibility | Preview pages + download gate | Download → parent outline | Lens + semantic families |
| **Parent outline** | Preparation proof | 10-week plan for text | Course | Chapter alignment + device focus |
| **Course page** | Conversion proof | “Method artifacts” strip (Annotation → Worksheet → Essay) | Enquire / Enroll | Method outputs |
| **Email** | Nurture + bridge | Short sequence: method → outcomes | Parent outline / course | Pattern + outcomes |
| **Results/Progress** | Validation loop | Before/after + metrics | Return to course | Outcomes |
