## Scripting Guidelines: The "Simple Truth" Translation
**CRITICAL**: Do not paste the "Pattern Function" directly into the script. It is too academic. You must translate it into "Simple English" (The "Paul Newman" Style).

| Academic Source (The Guide) | The Simple Truth (The Script) |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| "Establishes insider skills to authenticate membership." | "You don't get in by being nice. You get in by being useful." |
| "Contrasts privilege with insider knowledge of threat." | "To us, 20 vs 22 is fair. To him, it's a slaughter. He knows the math is a lie." |
| "Disoriented consciousness establishes perspective." | "Wake up with him. He flinches. He lives waiting for the next blow." |

**Rule**: Focus on **Power**, **Survival**, and **Stakes**. Avoid words like "authenticates", "juxtaposes", or "demonstrates" in the *voiceover* (keep them in the labels).
