# PARTNER PROOF LAYER v1.0

**Date:** February 1, 2026  
**Status:** Active — partner-facing proof strategy  
**Purpose:** Define the partner funnel and proof assets required to recruit individual tutors and tutoring companies.

**Aligned with:**  
- `docs/P_GTM_Partnership_v3_0.md`  
- `docs/P_GTM_Graduate_Network_v1_0.md`  
- `docs/theory/01_CREDENCE_PROBLEM.md`

## 1. WHY THE PARENT SITE IS NOT ENOUGH

The parent funnel provides **asset-based proof** (guides, demos, outcomes).  
Partners require **integration proof**:

| Partner Requirement | Parent Site Provides? |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| Method exists | ✅ Yes |
| Method can be transferred to others | ❌ No |
| Delivery QA gates | ❌ No |
| Economics/compensation model | ❌ No |
| Operational integration | ❌ No |

Conclusion: A partner-focused proof layer is required.

## 2. PARTNER FUNNEL (INDIVIDUALS + TUTORING COMPANIES)

**Audience:** Individual tutors and small tutoring companies  
**Positioning:** Outside institutional gatekeepers (credence bypass)

**Core path:**
```
Partner hub → Partner pack → Pilot → Proof-of-transfer
```

---

## 3. REQUIRED ASSETS

### 3.1 Partner Hub (Web Page)

**Suggested URL:** `/partners/` or `/partners/tutors/`

**Purpose:** One-page credibility layer for partners.

**Required sections:**
- What the program is
- Evidence of outcomes (short case study)
- What partners get (IP, training, brand, QA)
- What partners provide (delivery + local network)
- Economics summary (graduated hourly model)
- CTA: “Request partner pack” or “Apply to pilot”

### 3.2 Partner Pack (PDF / Deck)

**Purpose:** Operational + economic clarity.

**Contents:**
- TVODE overview + method transfer rationale
- Sample lesson plan + text guide
- Training timeline + QA gates
- Revenue model + example economics
- Pilot structure + success metrics

### 3.3 Proof-of-Transfer

**Purpose:** Show that the method works beyond the founder.

**Minimum proof:**
- One pilot case study (partner taught + outcomes)
- One partner‑taught demo video (visible TVODE structure)

---

## 4. QUALITY CONTROL (PARTNER INTEGRATION)

Required gates (from Graduate Network doc):
- Training completion (kernel + TVODE)
- Demo lesson observation
- Quarterly student work sampling
- Video co‑creation requirement
- Brand compliance check

These gates must be visible to partners to reduce perceived risk.

---

## 5. ECONOMICS SNAPSHOT (FOR PARTNERS)

Use the graduated hourly model from `P_GTM_Graduate_Network_v1_0.md`:

- Start with 1–2 students: partner retains most revenue (low barrier)
- Scale to 4–5 students: platform keeps larger share (economically viable)

Include a simple table or chart in the partner pack.

---

## 6. IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE

1. Build partner hub page  
2. Compile partner pack  
3. Run 1 pilot to create proof-of-transfer  
4. Publish pilot case study + partner demo video  
5. Use assets for outbound partner outreach  

---

## 7. SUCCESS METRICS

**Partner Funnel:**
- Partner pack requests
- Qualified partner interviews
- Pilot conversion rate

**Proof-of-transfer:**
- Partner-taught demo video published
- Pilot outcome report completed
