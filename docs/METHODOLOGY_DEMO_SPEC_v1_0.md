# METHODOLOGY DEMO PAGE SPEC v1.0

**Date:** January 24, 2026  
**Status:** Active  
**Related:** FUNNEL_ARCHITECTURE_v2_0, SITE_ARCHITECTURE_v2_0  
**Purpose:** Specification for parent-facing methodology demo pages (`/guides/[text]/`)

---

## 1. OVERVIEW

### 1.1 What This Is

A methodology demo page shows HOW you teach a specific text. It's a marketing page that makes quality visible to parents, not the full analysis guide for students.

### 1.2 What This Is NOT

| Methodology Demo | Analysis Guide |
|------------------|----------------|
| Marketing asset | Content asset |
| Parent audience | Student audience |
| Shows the method | IS the method |
| Preview depth | Full depth |
| Short (1-2 min read) | Long (10-15 min read) |
| Leads to enrollment | Leads to email capture |
| `/guides/[text]/` | `/vce/[text]/` |

### 1.3 Purpose

**Primary:** Build trust through visible expertise. Parent sees: "This is sophisticated. They clearly know this book. My child would learn from this."

**Secondary:** Text-match reinforcement. Parent confirms: "Yes, they teach the specific book my child is studying."

**Outcome:** Parent clicks through to `/course/` and enrolls.

---

## 2. AUDIENCE

### 2.1 Who

Parents of students in Years 7-12 who:
- Know their child is studying [Text]
- Know their child needs help with English
- Are evaluating tutoring options
- Cannot evaluate pedagogy directly (credence good)

### 2.2 What They Need to See

| Need | How Demo Addresses It |
|------|----------------------|
| Text match | Title, year level, curriculum mention |
| Quality signal | Sophisticated insight, visible expertise |
| Method clarity | "Here's how we teach" section |
| Outcome preview | "What students produce" section |
| Path to action | Clear CTA to course |

### 2.3 What They Don't Need

- Full analysis (that's for students)
- Step-by-step methodology (too much detail)
- Academic terminology (parent isn't the learner)
- Multiple CTAs (one clear path)

---

#### Section 1: Hero

**Purpose:** Confirm text match. Establish relevance.

**Content:**

- Author
- Year level badge (Y7-8, Y9-10, VCE, etc.)
- One-line hook: What the text is "really about" (your pattern insight)

**Example:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                             │
│  To Kill a Mockingbird                                      │
│  Harper Lee                                                 │
│                                                             │
│  [Y9-10]                                                    │
│                                                             │
│  "The Innocence Engine: How Lee constructs moral            │
│   education through a child's evolving perception"          │
│                                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Voice:** Confident, literary, signals expertise without jargon.

---

#### Section 2: What We Cover

**Purpose:** Show breadth. Parent sees you've mapped the text comprehensively.

**Content:**
- 3-4 themes (from kernel)
- Key devices (narrative voice, structure, imagery patterns)
- Text structure (how the book is organized, Freytag position)

**Format:** Clean list or card layout. Not exhaustive—representative.

**Example:**
```
WHAT WE COVER
─────────────

Themes                          Devices
• Moral education & growth      • Retrospective narration
• Innocence vs. experience      • Symbolic characterization  
• Justice and conscience        • Imagery patterns

Structure
• 5-act narrative arc
• Dual plot (trial + coming-of-age)
• Climax positioning and resolution
```

**Voice:** Factual, organized. Signals systematic approach.

---

#### Section 3: How We Teach It

**Purpose:** Make methodology visible. This is the trust-builder.

**Content:**
- Brief explanation of the 5-step approach
- NOT the full steps—the principle behind them
- Emphasize: understanding before writing

**Example:**
```
HOW WE TEACH IT
───────────────

Most tutoring teaches essay tricks. We teach the text.

Your child will learn to see what Harper Lee is actually doing—
how she uses Scout's childhood perspective to construct moral 
complexity. The writing follows naturally.

Our approach:
1. Understand what the text does (not just what happens)
2. See the patterns that create meaning
3. Build analytical sentences using evidence
4. Write essays that genuinely analyse

By the end, your child won't just know TKAM—they'll know 
how to think about any text this way.
```

**Voice:** Direct, confident. "We teach the text. The writing follows."

---

#### Section 4: Sample Insight

**Purpose:** Proof of expertise. One sophisticated observation that signals quality.

**Content:**
- One insight from your kernel/analysis
- Should be genuinely sophisticated (not SparkNotes-level)
- Parent may not fully understand it, but should recognize it as smart

**Example:**
```
SAMPLE INSIGHT
──────────────

"Lee's retrospective narration creates productive tension: 
adult Scout knows what child Scout doesn't, but chooses to 
preserve the child's limited perspective. This isn't naivety—
it's a deliberate technique that forces readers to experience 
moral education alongside the character, arriving at 
understanding through the same slow process of recognition."

This is the kind of sophisticated reading we teach.
```

**Voice:** Literary, analytical. This is where you show expertise.

---

#### Section 5: What Students Produce

**Purpose:** Outcome preview. What parent is buying.

**Content:**
- Description of final essay quality
- Skills that transfer (not just this text)
- Mention of feedback/progress visibility

**Example:**
```
WHAT STUDENTS PRODUCE
─────────────────────

By the end of the course, your child will have written a 
complete analytical essay on To Kill a Mockingbird—not a 
summary, but a genuine argument about how the text works.

They'll be able to:
• Identify narrative techniques and explain their effects
• Build analytical sentences with evidence
• Structure a coherent essay argument
• Apply this approach to other texts

You'll receive a progress report showing their development.
```

**Voice:** Outcome-focused. Addresses parent's actual goal.

---

#### Section 6: CTA

**Purpose:** Conversion. Clear path to enrollment.

**Content:**
- Single CTA button
- Price mention (optional—may want to keep on /course/)
- Reassurance (what they're getting)

**Example:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                             │
