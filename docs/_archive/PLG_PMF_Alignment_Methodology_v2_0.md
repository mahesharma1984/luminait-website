**Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** January 23, 2026  
**Based on:** ProductLed (Wes Bush), OpenView Research, Behavioral Marketing Theory  
**Integrates with:** KDD Methodology v2.0, Customer Slice v2.0  
**Canonical Application:** Distribution_Strategy_Reading_Writing_PLG_v1_0.md

## 1. Overview

PLG-PMF Alignment Methodology diagnoses whether a product with demonstrated market fit is ready for product-led growth distribution.

**Core Insight:** Product-Market Fit (PMF) and Product-Led Growth (PLG) readiness are independent dimensions. A product can have strong PMF but weak PLG readiness.

```
PMF: Does the product solve a real problem?
PLG: Can the product demonstrate that it solves the problem?

High PMF + Low PLG = Distribution bottleneck
High PMF + High PLG = Growth flywheel
Low PMF + High PLG = Viral but churns
Low PMF + Low PLG = Failure
```

## 2. The PLG Assessment

### 2.1 Three Dimensions

Score each dimension 1-5:

**Dimension A: Time to Value (TTV)**

| Level | Time Range | Score |
|-------|------------|-------|
| Instant | <1 minute | 5 |
| Fast | 1-10 minutes | 4 |
| Medium | 10 min - 1 day | 3 |
| Slow | 1 day - 1 week | 2 |
| Delayed | >1 week | 1 |

**Dimension B: Value Demonstrability**

| Level | User Experience | Score |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| Self-evident | "I got what I needed" | 5 |
| Observable | "Something is different now" | 4 |
| Achievable | "I did something" | 3 |
| Interpretable | "What does this mean?" | 2 |
| Deferred | "Did this help?" | 1 |

**Dimension C: Aha Moment Clarity**

| Clarity | Measurement | Score |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Binary | Single action = activated | 5 |
| Progressive | Multiple actions = activated | 4 |
| Composite | Scoring system = activated | 3 |
| Expert-judged | Human evaluation = activated | 2 |
| Subjective | No clear signal | 1 |

### 2.2 PLG Score Calculation

```
PLG Score = (TTV + Demonstrability + Aha Clarity) / 3
```

| PLG Score | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------|
| 4.0 - 5.0 | PLG-ready: Product can drive its own acquisition |
| 3.0 - 3.9 | PLG-possible: With optimisation, can support PLG motion |
| 2.0 - 2.9 | PLG-assisted: Needs entry point or hybrid motion |
| 1.0 - 1.9 | PLG-unsuited: Requires education/sales-led distribution |

---

## 3. The PLG-PMF Matrix

|  | Low PLG (1-2.9) | High PLG (3-5) |
|---|---|---|
| **Strong PMF** | **Quadrant A:** Distribution bottleneck | **Quadrant B:** Growth flywheel |
| **Weak PMF** | **Quadrant C:** Fundamental problem | **Quadrant D:** Viral but churns |

### 3.1 Quadrant A: High PMF, Low PLG

**Diagnosis:** Product delivers value but can't demonstrate it independently.

**Options:**

| Option | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| A1: Accept non-PLG | High LTV justifies CAC; niche market |
| A2: Build entry point | Can isolate demonstrable value slice |
| A3: Surface aha moments | Aha moments exist but are hidden |

**Entry Point Design (Option A2):**

An entry point is a PLG-ready product that funnels to the non-PLG core.

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| TTV | < 5 minutes |
| Demonstrability | Observable or self-evident |
| Aha moment | "I see what I'm missing" |
| CTA | Bridge to core product |

## 4. Distribution Routes

Based on PLG Score, route to appropriate strategy:

| PLG Score | Route | Funnel Architecture |
|-----------|-------|---------------------|
| 4.0+ | PLG-Ready | Traffic → Trial → Activation → Expansion |
| 3.0-3.9 | PLG-Possible | Traffic → Trial → Assisted Activation → Conversion |
| 2.0-2.9 | Hybrid | Traffic → Entry Point → Aha → Core Product → Conversion |
| <2.0 | Education | Traffic → Content → Trust → Trial → Support → Conversion |

## 5. Integration with Other Methodologies

| Methodology | Relationship |
|-------------|--------------|
| KDD v2.0 | PLG assessment is Stage 0 prerequisite to KDD |
| Customer Slice v2.0 | Atomic unit connects to "what's the aha moment?" |
| MASTER Operations | PLG Score determines which loop is primary |

## 6. Canonical Application

For the complete worked example applying this methodology to text-specific tutoring, see:

**Distribution_Strategy_Reading_Writing_PLG_v1_0.md**

Key findings from that application:
- Writing (core product): PLG Score ~1.8 (Quadrant A)
- Reading entry point: PLG Score ~4.0 (PLG-ready)
- Strategy: Hybrid funnel with reading as entry point

| Version | Date | Changes |
|---------|------|---------|
| 1.0 | Dec 17, 2025 | Initial framework |
| 2.0 | Jan 23, 2026 | Trimmed to methodology only; product-specific examples moved to canonical docs |
