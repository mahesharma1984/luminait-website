# FRAMEWORK: Credence Good Conversion Through Multi-Touchpoint Credibility Building

**Version:** 1.2
**Date:** January 27, 2026 (Updated)
**Supersedes:** V1.2
**Status:** Active — **Stage 2 Implementation COMPLETE**
**Builds on:** PMF_Addendum_v1_0, Distribution_Strategy_v1_0, FUNNEL_ARCHITECTURE_v2_0, FRAMEWORK_Workbook_Production_v1
**Theoretical basis:** SEC Classification (Darby & Karni 1973), Hierarchy of Effects (Lavidge & Steiner 1961)

**Implementation Status:**
- ✅ **Stage 1 (Text Match):** Homepage with text grid — LIVE
- ✅ **Stage 2 (Preparation Proof):** 18 text-specific course outlines — **COMPLETE (Jan 27, 2026)**
- ⏳ **Stage 3 (Method Confidence):** Generic pedagogy pages — Existing
- ✅ **Stage 4 (Action):** Course page with enrollment — LIVE

**Key Achievement:** The core credibility gap (Stage 2) has been closed. Parents can now verify text-specific preparation before committing.

---

## 1. THE CORE TENSION

### 1.1 The Differentiation Claim

From PMF Framework:
> "Generic tutoring doesn't address the specific text... No provider systematically builds classes around prescribed texts"

The value proposition IS text-specificity. You're not selling "essay writing tutoring" — you're selling "The Giver tutoring."

### 1.2 The Asset Mismatch

Current pedagogical pages are **generic**:

| Page | Content | Text-Specific? |
|------|---------|----------------|
| syllabus.html | 10-week curriculum overview | No |
| sample.html | Generic worksheet preview | No |
| progress.html | Example report format | No |
| results.html | Aggregate outcome stats | No |

These prove you have A method. They don't prove you've applied it to The Giver.

### 1.3 The Credibility Gap

```
CLAIM: "We teach The Giver specifically"
PROOF: Generic pages showing method structure

PARENT QUESTION: "But have you actually prepared for The Giver?"
ANSWER: ??? (gap)
```

The parent can verify text match (Stage 1) but has no evidence of text-specific preparation (Stage 2).

---

## 2. THEORETICAL FOUNDATION

### 2.1 Credence Goods and Proof Points

Parents cannot evaluate pedagogical quality. They rely on **signals** that proxy for quality:

| Signal Type | What It Shows | Credibility Impact |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Text match | "They teach this book" | Entry (binary) |
| Text match | "They teach this book" | Entry (binary) |
| School match | "They know MY school" | Entry + Trust (High) |
| Method visible | "They have a system" | Medium |
| Text-specific preparation | "They've done the work for THIS book" | High |
| Outcomes | "It worked for others" | High (if available) |

**Key insight:** Text-specific preparation is a stronger signal than generic method visibility because it's harder to fake and directly addresses the parent's actual need.

### 2.2 The Proof Point Hierarchy

```
WEAKEST
    │
    ├── "We teach English" (generic claim)
    ├── "We have a methodology" (generic proof)
    ├── "We teach The Giver" (specific claim, no proof)
    ├── "Here's our 10-week method" (generic proof of capability)
    ├── "Here's our 10-week plan FOR The Giver" (specific proof) ← TARGET
    ├── "Here's the booklist for McKinnon SC" (school-specific proof) ← NEW TARGET
    ├── "Here's a worksheet FROM The Giver" (specific artifact)
    ├── "Here's student work ON The Giver" (specific outcome)
    │
STRONGEST
```

The goal: Move from generic proof to text-specific proof without giving away the product.

## 3. THE CREDIBILITY SEQUENCE (REVISED)

### 3.1 Four Stages

| Stage | Parent Question | What Resolves It | Text-Specific? |
|-------|-----------------|------------------|----------------|
| 1. Text Match | "Do they teach this book?" | Homepage text grid | Yes (list) |
| 1.5. School Match | "Do they know my child's context?" | School-specific landing page | **Yes (context)** |
| 2. Preparation Proof | "Have they prepared for THIS book?" | Text-specific course outline | **Yes (new)** |
| 3. Method Confidence | "Do they have a real system?" | Generic pedagogy pages | No |
| 4. Action | "What do I get? How much?" | Course page | No |

### 3.2 The New Asset: Text-Specific Course Outline

**What it is:** A 1-page document showing the 10-week plan mapped to the specific text.

**What it contains:**
- Week-by-week breakdown with chapter references
- Literary focus for each week (devices, themes, techniques)
- Skill progression (what student learns each week)
- Output preview (sample TVODE sentence or paragraph)

**What it proves:**
- "They've mapped every chapter"
- "They know what devices matter in THIS text"
- "They've thought through the progression"
- "This is what my child will produce"

**What it doesn't give away:**
- The actual worksheets
- The full analysis
- The teaching method details

### 3.3 The Minimal Proof Point Formula

```
TEXT-SPECIFIC COURSE OUTLINE
├── Week-by-week structure (shows preparation depth)
├── Chapter/section mapping (proves text knowledge)
├── Device/theme focus per week (shows sophistication)
├── One sample output (shows what student produces)
└── CTA to enroll
```

This is the minimum text-specific proof that demonstrates preparation without giving away the product.

## 4. EXISTING ASSETS MAPPED

### 4.1 What Exists (Text-Specific)

From project knowledge, for texts like The Giver:

| Asset | Content | Usable For |
|-------|---------|------------|
| Kernel Stage 1 | Structure, Freytag mapping | Week-by-week chapter breakdown |
| Kernel Stage 4 | Pattern, device priorities | Device focus per week |
| Kernel Stage 5 | Device evidence with quotes | Sample analysis content |
| Kernel Stage 6 | Reasoning document | Theme articulation |
| Week 0-5 worksheets | Full teaching materials | Extract outline, sample output |
| Workbook framework | Production process | Can generate per text |

**Key realisation:** The text-specific content exists in the kernel and worksheets. It just needs to be extracted into a parent-facing outline format.

### 4.2 What Exists (Generic)

| Page | URL | Stage | Purpose |
|------|-----|-------|---------|
| Homepage | / | Stage 1 | Text match (grid of books) |
| Syllabus | /syllabus | Stage 3 | Generic method overview |
| Sample | /sample | Stage 3 | Generic worksheet preview |
| Progress | /progress | Stage 3 | Report format example |
| Results | /results | Stage 3 | Outcome stats |
| Course | /course | Stage 4 | Enrollment |

### 4.3 What's Missing → What's Been Implemented

**Status as of January 27, 2026:**

| Asset | Stage | Purpose | Priority | Status |
|-------|-------|---------|----------|--------|
| Text-specific course outline | Stage 2 | Prove preparation | **HIGH** | ✅ **DONE** - 18 guides live |
| Text-specific sample output | Stage 2 | Show what student produces | **HIGH** | ⚠️ Partial - in outcomes list, needs visual |
| Parent testimonials | Stage 3 | Social proof | Medium | ⏳ Planned |
| Text-specific outcomes | Stage 3 | "Students studying X achieved..." | Low | ⏳ Need data |

**Implementation Details:**

**✅ Text-Specific Course Outlines (COMPLETE)**
- **Location 1:** 8 homepage books at root level (`/the-giver/`, `/macbeth/`, etc.)
- **Location 2:** 10 additional guides in `/curriculum/` directory
- **Total:** 18 parent curriculum guides
- **Content:** 10-week breakdown with topics, techniques, phases, outcomes
- **Build System:** `build-homepage-guides.js` and `build-parent-guides.js`
- **Design:** Fully design-system compliant (288 lines vs old 682 lines)
- **Template:** `/src/templates/_parent-guide-template.html`
- **Data:** JSON files in `/data/parent-guides/`

**What This Achieves:**
- ✅ Stage 2 credibility: Proves text-specific preparation
- ✅ Parent can see: "They've mapped every week for this book"
- ✅ SEO: Text-specific URLs rank for "[book] tutoring"
- ✅ Conversion: Clear path from homepage → text page → course

**See:** `docs/BUILD_SYSTEM.md` for complete build documentation.

## 9. IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY

### 9.1 First Text

Pick one text to pilot:
- Has complete kernel (Stages 1-6)
- Has worksheets developed
- High demand (multiple schools teach it)

**Candidate:** The Giver (kernel complete, worksheets exist, Y7-8 demand)

### 9.2 Production Sequence

1. **Extract outline content** from The Giver kernel + worksheets
2. **Draft outline page** following spec
3. **Test with 1-2 parents** — does this answer their questions?
4. **Refine and template** — create repeatable format
5. **Produce for other texts** — scale across book list

### 9.3 Effort Estimate

| Task | Effort | Dependency |
|------|--------|------------|
| Extract content from kernel | 30 min/text | Kernel complete |
| Draft outline page | 1 hour/text | Content extracted |
| Design/style page | 2 hours (one-time) | Template created |
| Produce additional texts | 1 hour/text | Template exists |

---

## 10. SUMMARY

**The problem:** Generic pedagogy pages prove method but not text-specific preparation.

**The solution:** Text-specific course outlines that show 10-week plan mapped to chapters, devices, and themes for each book.

**The proof point formula:**
- Week-by-week structure with chapter references
- Device/theme focus showing text knowledge
- One sample output showing what student produces
- CTA to enroll

**The journey:**
```
Homepage (text match) → Text outline (preparation proof) → Course (enroll)
```

**What's different from v1.1:**
- Identified the gap between claim and proof
- Defined new asset type: text-specific course outline
- Specified content, sources, and production process
- Set implementation priority

---

## 11. ADDENDUM: TRUST & AESTHETICS (v1.3)

### 11.1 The "Natural" Aesthetic
To counter the "AI/Tech" stigma, the visual design must signal "Academic/Human" rather than "SaaS/Algorithm".
- **Asset:** "Warm Paper" background (#FDFCF8) + Serif Typography (Fraunces).
- **Effect:** Feels like a university press or high-end textbook.

### 11.2 Human Trust Signals
Framework v1.2 focused on *competence* (text match). v1.3 adds *connection*:
- **Teacher Profiles:** Real human faces are mandatory to prove it's not just a bot.
- **Testimonials:** Specific "Parent Stories" reinforce the competence claims.
- **Sample Output:** Visual snippets of student writing prove the "Natural" outcome.
