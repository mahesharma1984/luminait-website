# GRADUATE NETWORK FRANCHISE STRATEGY v1.0

**Date:** January 30, 2026
**Status:** Active — strategic framework for distributed teaching network
**Related:** [P_GTM_Partnership_v3_0.md](P_GTM_Partnership_v3_0.md), [Local SEO Strategy](technical/LOCAL_SEO_STRATEGY.md), [Credence Problem](theory/01_CREDENCE_PROBLEM.md)

## 1. STRATEGIC OVERVIEW

### 1.1 The Core Exchange

**Capital Arbitrage Model:**

| Your Capital | Their Capital |
|--------------|---------------|
| **IP** — Kernel-to-pedagogy pipeline, TVODE methodology, text-specific materials | **Social Network** — School-specific trust, local parent networks, delivery capacity |
| Non-rivalrous (scales infinitely) | Exclusive (McKinnon grad has McKinnon trust you don't) |
| Marginal cost ≈ $0 once created | High marginal cost (time + delivery) |

**Dual-Value Channel:**

The graduate network delivers two types of value simultaneously:

1. **Delivery Capacity** — They fulfill local demand you can't serve directly
2. **Content Engine** — Each graduate generates authentic, school-specific content that feeds your social media

The content angle is particularly powerful because:
- They have natural credibility ("I went to McKinnon, scored 45 in English")
- Their content reaches their network organically (no ad spend)
- It's non-rivalrous for you — 5 graduates = 5x content output, same IP input

**The Exchange:**
- You provide: Materials, training, brand, methodology, QA systems, payment collection
- Graduate provides: Local delivery, school network access, student recruitment, content creation
- Revenue model: Graduated hourly rate (see Section 3)

### 1.2 Why This Works

**Problem it solves:**
- You can't directly access McKinnon parent networks (blocking system)
- Generic tutors can't replicate text-specific methodology (lack IP)
- Hiring full-time tutors doesn't scale economically

**Solution:**
- Graduate has local trust (alumni identity)
- You license methodology (maintains quality)
- School-by-school presence (defensible moat)

**Alignment with credence bypass:**
- Parent question shifts from "Do I trust this tutor?" → "Do I trust LuminAIT's system?"
- Graduate visibly teaches YOUR methodology (TVODE structure)
- Proof point: "Ex-McKinnon student teaches McKinnon texts using LuminAIT method"

---

## 2. PARTNERSHIP FRAMEWORK (P_GTM GATES)

### 2.1 Gap-Container-Exchange Analysis

| Gate | Question | Assessment |
|------|----------|------------|
| **Gap** | Is this outside your blocking system? | ✅ YES — You can't directly access school networks; graduate can |
| **Container** | Does graduate have infrastructure? | ✅ YES — Social network, parent trust, local reputation |
| **Exchange** | Is there clear mutual value? | ✅ YES — IP for network access (both capitals are scarce) |

### 2.2 Partner Type Classification

**Not an institutional gatekeeper** (doesn't control school policy)
**Not just an individual tutor** (represents a distribution channel)

**Classification:** Distributed delivery partner with local network access

**Strategic role:** Build market awareness through human distribution agents (your materials create inbound interest)

---

## 3. BUSINESS MODEL

### 3.1 Building Phase: Graduated Hourly Rate

**Philosophy:** During the building phase, there are no upfront payments on either side. You collect course fees from parents and pay graduates weekly at a graduated hourly rate that increases with class size.

**Why graduated rate (not flat %):**
- Small classes: Graduate keeps more → incentive to start
- Larger classes: You keep more → fair since same work, more revenue
- Each additional student adds meaningful income → no disincentive ceiling

**Payment Structure:**

| Students | Revenue/Term | Graduate $/hr | Graduate Total | You Keep | Your % |
|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------|----------|--------|
| 1 | $550 | $55 | $550 | $0 | 0% |
| 2 | $1,100 | $65 | $650 | $450 | 41% |
| 3 | $1,650 | $75 | $750 | $900 | 55% |
| 4 | $2,200 | $85 | $850 | $1,350 | 61% |
| 5 | $2,750 | $100 | $1,000 | $1,750 | 64% |

*Assumptions: $550/student/term (10 weeks × $55), 1 group session/week, 10 hours total work*

**Graduate Earnings Growth (per additional student):**
- 1→2: +$100/term
- 2→3: +$100/term
- 3→4: +$100/term
- 4→5: +$150/term (bonus for filling class)

**Key mechanics:**
- You collect fees upfront from parents
- You pay graduate weekly ($10-15/week at full class)
- Graduate never handles money → simpler compliance
- At 1 student, graduate gets 100% → zero barrier to start

### 3.2 Revenue Projections

**Scenario: One Graduate (McKinnon) - Building Phase**

| Term | Students | Revenue | You Keep | Graduate Keeps |
|------|----------|---------|----------|----------------|
| Term 1 | 2 | $1,100 | $450 | $650 |
| Term 2 | 4 | $2,200 | $1,350 | $850 |
| Term 3 | 5 | $2,750 | $1,750 | $1,000 |
| **Year 1** | — | **$6,050** | **$3,550** | **$2,500** |

**Scenario: Network of 5 Graduates at Scale (5 students each)**

| Graduates | Students | Revenue/Term | You Keep/Term | Annual (3 terms) |
|-----------|----------|--------------|---------------|------------------|
| 1 | 5 | $2,750 | $1,750 | $5,250 |
| 3 | 15 | $8,250 | $5,250 | $15,750 |
| 5 | 25 | $13,750 | $8,750 | $26,250 |

**Effective economics:**
- Your time: ~60 hours/year per graduate (training + QA)
- Revenue per graduate at scale: $5,250/year
- Effective rate: $87/hour for QA work
- But: Zero delivery time + content generation value (see Section 3.3)

**Key advantage:** Scales without linear time investment. At 5 graduates, you're earning $26K/year for ~300 hours of support work (~$87/hr), plus getting 5x content output for social media.

### 3.3 Future Phase: Upfront Licensing

Once model is proven (Year 2+), consider adding:

```
Graduate Investment:
  - $2,500 upfront (training + materials licensing)
  - Graduated hourly rate continues

Unlocks:
  - Priority access to new texts/materials
  - Co-branded marketing materials
  - Featured placement on school pages
```

This is optional and only for proven graduates who want to formalize the relationship.

## 4. QUALITY CONTROL FRAMEWORK

### 4.1 The Delegability Problem

**From Content Derivation Principle:**
> Derive pedagogy from the source material. Don't impose generic frameworks.

**Risk:** Graduate teaches generically using your materials → recreates credence trap

**Solution:** Enforce kernel fidelity through quality gates

### 4.2 Quality Gates

| Gate | Frequency | Mechanism | Why |
|------|-----------|-----------|-----|
| **Training completion** | Once (pre-launch) | Graduate articulates kernel → TVODE logic | Ensures methodology understanding |
| **Demo lesson observation** | Week 1 + quarterly | You observe graduate teaching, provide feedback | Verify visible methodology |
| **Student work sampling** | Quarterly | Review 3-5 essays per term vs. benchmarks | Check outcome alignment |
| **Outcome measurement** | End of term | Compare student improvement to your direct teaching | Validate IP transfer |
| **Video co-creation** | Ongoing | Graduate records 1-2 analysis videos per term | Proof of competence + marketing asset |
| **Brand compliance** | Quarterly | Marketing materials, communication follow templates | Maintain consistency |

### 4.3 Training Program Structure

**Phase 1 (Week 1): Methodology Foundations**
- Kernel extraction process (how you derive pedagogy from text analysis)
- TVODE structure application
- Pattern recognition vs. generic advice
- Style guide + alignment spec review

**Phase 2 (Week 2): Delivery Practice**
- Teach demo week to pilot cohort
- You observe, provide real-time feedback
- Graduate adapts based on student responses
- Refine delivery approach

**Phase 3 (Ongoing): Support + QA**
- Monthly check-in on lesson plans
- Quarterly student work review
- Annual curriculum updates
- Video content collaboration

**Documentation Required:**
- TVODE Training Manual
- Kernel Extraction Checklist (from GUIDE_EXTRACTION_CHECKLIST.md)
- Lesson Plan Templates (week-by-week for each text)
- Observation Rubric
- Franchise Agreement (legal)

## 4A. GRADUATE CONTENT PROGRAM

### 4A.1 Strategic Value of Graduate Content

The graduate network isn't just a delivery channel—it's a content engine. Each graduate produces authentic, school-specific content that feeds your social media presence.

**Why graduate content is powerful:**

| Factor | Graduate Content | Your Content |
|--------|------------------|--------------|
| Credibility | "I went to McKinnon, scored 45" | External authority |
| Reach | Organic to their school network | Requires ad spend |
| Volume | 5 graduates = 5x output | Limited by your time |
| Authenticity | Alumni identity = local trust | Outsider positioning |

**Key insight:** Content creation is non-rivalrous for you. 5 graduates = 5x content output for the same IP input.

### 4A.2 Content Types and Expectations

**Required content (per term):**

| Content Type | Frequency | Purpose | Example |
|--------------|-----------|---------|---------|
| **30-sec analysis video** | 2/term | Demonstrate TVODE methodology | "How I'd approach Macbeth's 'unsex me' soliloquy" |
| **Before/after framing** | 1/term | Show transformation | "Before LuminAIT I couldn't... now I can..." |
| **Student success story** | 1/term | Proof of outcomes | "My student improved from C to A" |

**Optional content (encouraged):**

| Content Type | Frequency | Purpose |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| Study tips for specific text | Weekly | SEO + engagement |
| Exam prep content | Before SACs/exams | High-intent audience |
| Behind-the-scenes teaching | Monthly | Humanize the brand |

### 4A.3 Content Guidelines

**Must show:**
1. **Visible methodology** — TVODE structure, not generic advice
2. **Text-specific application** — "How to analyze Macbeth" not "How to write essays"
3. **Before/after framing** — Transformation narrative that credits the system

**Must avoid:**
1. **Pure polish** — If it just shows "smart analysis," parent thinks "this grad is talented" not "this system works"
2. **Generic tips** — Recreates commoditized tutoring positioning
3. **Off-brand messaging** — Follow tone/style guidelines

**Content review process:**
- Graduate drafts content
- You review before posting (first 3 months)
- After 3 months: graduate posts directly, you spot-check

### 4A.4 Content Distribution

**Channels:**

| Channel | Owner | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Graduate's personal social | Graduate | Reach their school network |
| LuminAIT main channels | You | Aggregate best content |
| School landing pages | You | Embed in `/schools/[slug]/` |

**Cross-posting flow:**
1. Graduate posts to their Instagram/TikTok
2. Best content repurposed to LuminAIT channels
3. Analysis videos embedded in relevant school pages

**Network effect:** Graduate content drives discovery → Parents enroll → More graduates → More content

### 4A.5 Content Program Metrics

| Metric | Target (per graduate/term) |
|--------|---------------------------|
| Videos posted | 3+ |
| Combined reach | 500+ views |
| Engagement rate | 3%+ |
| Inquiries attributed | 2+ |

**Tracking:**
- UTM links in graduate bios
- "How did you hear about us?" on enrollment form
- Monthly content performance review

---

## 5. SCHOOL-BY-SCHOOL MOAT

### 5.1 Local Authority Amplification

**How it works:**

```
McKinnon graduate → teaches McKinnon texts → "LuminAIT at McKinnon"
Scotch graduate → teaches Scotch texts → "LuminAIT at Scotch"
Caulfield graduate → teaches Caulfield texts → "LuminAIT at Caulfield"
= Geographic coverage competitors can't replicate
```

**Network effect:**
- Each school page (`/schools/mckinnon-sc/`) ranks for "[School] English tutor"
- Graduate delivers in that school's network
- Word-of-mouth amplifies SEO
- Local monopoly on "text-specific tutoring at [School]"

### 5.2 Integration with Local SEO Strategy

**From LOCAL_SEO_STRATEGY.md — McKinnon Model:**

| SEO Element | Graduate Network Integration |
|-------------|------------------------------|
| School landing page | `/schools/mckinnon-sc/` shows 2026 booklist + texts |
| Local search ranking | "McKinnon English tutor" → page with LocalBusiness schema |
| Graduate presence | McKinnon alumni teaches = authentic local authority |
| Reviews | Parents from McKinnon leave Google reviews mentioning school |
| Video content | Graduate records analysis videos → embedded in school page |

**Compounding moat:**
- Competitor sees your McKinnon page + graduate
- To replicate, they need: (1) McKinnon alumni, (2) text-specific materials, (3) TVODE methodology, (4) local reviews
- Hard to copy one element; impossible to copy all four

### 5.3 Defensibility Analysis

**What competitors would need to replicate:**

| Element | Your Position | Competitor Position |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| Alumni network | McKinnon, Scotch, Caulfield, MLC, Lauriston grads | Need to recruit same schools |
| Text-specific IP | 18+ kernels, TVODE structure, lesson plans | Generic tutoring advice |
| Local SEO presence | School pages with schema, reviews, video | Single homepage |
| Brand authority | "LuminAIT at [School]" positioning | Unknown brand |

**Time to replicate:** 12-18 months (assuming they figure out the model)
**Cost to replicate:** $50K+ (materials, training, SEO, recruiting)
**Likelihood:** Low (requires both IP creation AND network building)

---

## 6. CREDENCE BYPASS MECHANICS

### 6.1 Proof Point Transfer

**Current model (you teach directly):**
> "I (Mahesh) teach this text using TVODE analysis"

**Franchise model (graduate teaches):**
> "I (McKinnon grad) teach this text using LuminAIT's TVODE analysis"

**Critical requirement:** Parent must know + trust LuminAIT brand

### 6.2 How Brand Credibility Transfers

**Proof hierarchy position:**

```
WEAKEST: "We teach English"
         "We have a methodology"
         "We teach The Giver"
         "Here's our 10-week plan FOR The Giver"
         "Here's LuminAIT's plan taught by [McKinnon grad]" ← Graduate model
         "Watch [Graduate] analyze The Giver using TVODE"
STRONGEST: "Here's student work from [Graduate's] cohort"
```

**Graduate video must show:**
1. Before/after framing ("I couldn't analyze, LuminAIT taught me TVODE, now I can")
2. Visible methodology (demonstrates TVODE structure, not generic advice)
3. Text-specific application (not "how to write essays" but "how to analyze Macbeth using TVODE")

**If video just shows polished analysis without context:**
- Parent thinks "This grad is talented" (not "This system works")
- Recreates credence trap

### 6.3 Risk Mitigation

**Risk:** Graduate teaches generically, dilutes brand

**Mitigation:**
1. Training enforces kernel-derivation (not generic frameworks)
2. Observation verifies TVODE structure is visible in teaching
3. Video co-creation ensures graduate can demonstrate methodology
4. Student outcome tracking validates IP transfer

**Contract clause:** Graduate agrees to teach using LuminAIT methodology and brand guidelines, subject to quarterly review

---

## 7. IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

### Phase 0: Build Proof of Concept (8 weeks)

**Goal:** Document IP + create pilot-ready materials

- [ ] **Week 1-2:** TVODE Training Manual (how to teach kernel-derived pedagogy)
- [ ] **Week 3-4:** Full semester curriculum for McKinnon (4 texts, 10 weeks each)
- [ ] **Week 5-6:** Observation rubric + QA checklist + franchise agreement
- [ ] **Week 7-8:** Record 3-5 demo videos showing TVODE analysis

**Deliverable:** Franchise package ready to hand to first graduate

### Phase 1: Pilot with One Graduate (1 term = 10 weeks)

**Goal:** Validate IP transfer + measure outcomes

**Graduate selection criteria:**
- McKinnon alumni (strong VCE results, ideally 40+ study score)
- Currently at university (credibility signal)
- Available to teach 2 evenings/week + Saturday
- Willing to follow methodology (not freelance)

**Execution:**
- [ ] **Week 1-2:** Intensive training (kernel, TVODE, delivery practice)
- [ ] **Week 3:** Graduate teaches Week 1, you observe
- [ ] **Week 4-12:** Graduate delivers independently, monthly check-in
- [ ] **Week 13:** Review student outcomes vs. your direct teaching baseline

**Success metrics:**
- Student essay improvement ≥ 80% of your direct teaching baseline
- Graduate can articulate TVODE logic in observation
- No parent complaints about methodology clarity

**Decision point:** If outcomes match, proceed to Phase 2. If not, refine training.

### Phase 2: Scale to 3 Schools (Term 2 + Term 3)

**Goal:** Replicate to multiple schools + standardize QA

**Schools:** McKinnon (proven), Scotch, Caulfield

**Execution:**
- [ ] Recruit 2 additional graduates (Scotch + Caulfield alumni)
- [ ] Refine training based on Phase 1 learnings
- [ ] Use Phase 1 case study in recruitment ("See what we achieved at McKinnon")
- [ ] Standardize QA process (same rubric, same observation template)
- [ ] Build internal dashboard tracking outcome metrics across all graduates

**Deliverable:** 3 active school networks + proven training/QA process

### Phase 3: Network Expansion (Year 2)

**Goal:** 6-8 schools + introduce video marketing

**Expansion criteria:**
- Top 6-8 Melbourne schools by enrollment
- Mix of state/private, single-sex/co-ed
- Priority: Schools whose booklists include existing 18 texts

**Execution:**
- [ ] Expand to MLC, Lauriston, Korowa, Xavier, etc.
- [ ] Graduates create 1-2 analysis videos per term (Funnel 3 content)
- [ ] Build referral incentives (graduate who recruits another graduate gets bonus)
- [ ] Measure total network outcomes, not individual tutor outcomes

**Revenue target:** $180K+ annual recurring (6 graduates × $30K avg)

---

## 8. RISKS AND MITIGATION

### 8.1 Quality Dilution Risk

**Risk:** Graduate teaches generically, brand credibility erodes

**Likelihood:** High without gates
**Impact:** High (recreates credence trap)

**Mitigation:**
- Quarterly observation (you watch 1-2 lessons per term)
- Student work sampling (verify outcomes match baseline)
- Video co-creation (graduate must demonstrate methodology on camera)
- Contract includes quality standards + termination clause

### 8.2 Graduate Departure Risk

**Risk:** Graduate leaves, takes students with them

**Likelihood:** Medium (if graduate builds strong student relationships)
**Impact:** Medium (lose one school network)

**Mitigation:**
- Non-compete clause (1 year, within 5km of school)
- Emphasize relationship is with system, not person (brand > individual)
- Maintain school relationship through your own video content + SEO presence
- Keep materials proprietary (graduate doesn't own curriculum)

### 8.3 Competitor Poaching Risk

**Risk:** Competitor offers graduate better terms, recruits them away

**Likelihood:** Low initially, medium after proof-of-concept
**Impact:** Medium (lose trained graduate + need to replace)

**Mitigation:**
- Make graduation from your training program a credibility signal (adds to CV)
- Frequent curriculum updates keep graduate dependent on your materials
- Build graduate community (peer network creates retention)
- Revenue share is competitive (80% > most tutoring platforms)

### 8.4 Revenue Share Enforcement Risk

**Risk:** Graduate underreports revenue, you lose share

**Likelihood:** Low with direct enrollment system, medium with cash payments
**Impact:** Medium (revenue leakage)

**Mitigation:**
- Require graduate to use your enrollment system (you collect fees, pay them 75-80%)
- If they collect directly, require monthly revenue reports + audit rights
- Build trust through relationship (regular check-ins reduce incentive to cheat)

---

## 10. ALIGNMENT WITH EXISTING STRATEGY

### 10.1 Integration with Three-Funnel Architecture

**Funnel 1 (Analysis Guides):**
- Graduate uses your guides in teaching
- Students find guides via SEO, then enroll with local graduate
- Guide → Local graduate = smooth handoff

**Funnel 2 (Parent-Direct):**
- Parent finds `/schools/mckinnon-sc/` page
- Sees 2026 booklist + course outlines
- Enrolls with McKinnon graduate = local fulfillment

**Funnel 3 (Video-to-Parent):**
- Graduate creates 30-sec analysis videos
- Posts to social media → reaches school network
- Parent sees video, recognizes graduate, enrolls

**Network effect:** All three funnels drive to same local graduate → amplifies conversion

### 10.2 Integration with Local SEO Strategy

**From LOCAL_SEO_STRATEGY.md — School-by-School Moat:**

| SEO Tactic | Graduate Network Amplification |
|------------|-------------------------------|
| School landing pages | Graduate teaches at that school → authentic presence |
| LocalBusiness schema | Each graduate has address → multiple local signals |
| Reviews | Parents from specific school → geo-targeted reviews |
| NAP consistency | Graduate location on Google Business Profile |
| Video content | Graduate analysis videos → embedded in school pages |

**The moat compounds:** SEO drives discovery → Graduate delivers → Reviews amplify SEO

### 10.3 Integration with Credence Framework

**From 01_CREDENCE_PROBLEM.md — Bypass Mechanisms:**

| Traditional Credential | LuminAIT Substitute | Graduate Network Enhancement |
|----------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Degree/qualification | Visible methodology | Graduate demonstrates TVODE in teaching |
| School reputation | Text-specific match | Graduate is alumni → school credibility |
| Years of experience | Student work samples | Graduate's cohort outcomes = proof |

**Graduate amplifies credence bypass by adding alumni identity to methodology proof**
