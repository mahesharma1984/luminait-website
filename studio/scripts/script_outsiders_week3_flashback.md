### Phase 2: Narration (The Text)
**Visual**: The full text appears on screen. No highlights yet.
**Audio**: 
"I started in, talking a little faster than I usually do because I don't like to think about it either. It was almost four months ago. I had walked down to the DX station to get a bottle of pop..."

### Phase 3: Analysis (Deconstruction)
**Visual**: Highlight "talking a little faster" (Red ZigZag - Panic).
**Audio**: 
"Look at the speed. 'Talking a little faster'. He's rushing. Why?"

**Visual**: Highlight "I don't like to think about it either" (Grey Box - Avoidance).
**Audio**: 
"Because he says, 'I don't like to think about it.' He's trying to get it over with. The past is intruding on the present."

**Visual**: Highlight "It was almost four months ago" (Clock/Time Icon).
**Audio**:
"That's what a Flashback does in *The Outsiders*. It interrupts the story because trauma interrupts life. It's not a movie scene. It's a wound re-opening."

**Audio**: 
"We analyze how time works in the novel in Week 3 of our Parent Curriculum."
