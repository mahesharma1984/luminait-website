## The Script & Visual Flow

| Time | Phase | Visual Action (The Rostrum) | Voiceover Script (Plain English) |
|------|-------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **0:00** | **Phase 0: Intro** | **[Image]** Book Cover (Clean, Iconic) fills screen. <br> **[Title]** "THE OUTSIDERS" | "Most students read *The Outsiders* as a simple story about gangs. But S.E. Hinton is doing something much smarter hidden in plain sight." |
| **0:06** | **Phase 1: Context** | **[Image]** Paul Newman (1967, Cool Hand Luke) slides in. | "Take the very first page. 'I wished I looked like Paul Newman.' To us, that's just a name. To a greaser in 1967, he was *power*." |
| **0:12** | **Phase 1: Context** | **[Image Overlay]** Greasers vs Socs (Visual Contrast). | "He represents the world Ponyboy can't have. It sets the stakes immediately." |
| **0:16** | **Phase 2: Text** | **[Action]** Images fade. Camera focuses on the sentence in the book. <br> **[Highlight]** "I had only two things on my mind..." | "Now, look at the writing. He's worrying about a ride home. That's the 14-year-old kid in the moment." |
| **0:22** | **Phase 2: Text** | **[Highlight]** "I was wishing..." | "But the voice *telling* the story? That's the older, wiser Ponyboy looking back. We call this the 'Two Brains' problem." |
| **0:30** | **Phase 3: System** | **[Label]** "Dual Consciousness" | "In your essay, you call this **Dual Consciousness**. The gap between what he felt *then* and what he knows *now*." |
