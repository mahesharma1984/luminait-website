# LuminAIT Video Studio

The **Video Studio** is a browser-based tool for creating high-quality, animated literary analysis videos without editing software.

## How to Use

1.  Open `studio/outsiders-scene.html` in Chrome or Safari.
2.  Set your browser to **Fullscreen (F11)** to hide the URL bar.
3.  Start your screen recording (QuickTime or OBS).
4.  **Press SPACEBAR** to advance the animation steps while you read the script.

## The Workflow

*   **Step 0 (Reset)**: The Book Cover. Hook the audience.
*   **Step 1 (Context)**: Paul Newman photo appears. Explain the "Idol".
*   **Step 2 (Overlay)**: "THE IDOL" text appears.
*   **Step 3 (Text)**: Transition to the book page.
*   **Step 4 (Highlight)**: Yellow highlight on "Two things on my mind". Explain surface concern.
*   **Step 5 (Pivot)**: Zoom in on "Wishing I looked like...". Explain the Narrator's voice.
*   **Step 6 (Meta)**: Blue underline + Label "Dual Consciousness".

## Creating New Scenes

1.  Duplicate `outsiders-scene.html`.
2.  Update the **Assets** (Images in `assets/`).
3.  Update the **Text HTML**.
4.  Update the **Script Logic** (at the bottom of the file) to match your new steps.
