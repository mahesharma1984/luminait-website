- `docs/technical/PARTNER_PROOF_LAYER.md`

## Problem

We have a strong partner unit economics narrative, but no partner-facing assets to communicate it. The current site is parent-facing and does not provide integration proof, operational clarity, or outcome-bounded terms for partners.

Partners need:
- A concise partner hub page that communicates the causal chain and partnership model
- A downloadable partner pack (PDF/deck) with operational details, economics, and pilot structure

---

## Goal

Create partner-facing proof assets that translate the unit economics narrative into a clear offer:
- A web page that acts as the partner hub
- A PDF pack that explains the system, economics, pilot terms, and proof requirements

---

## Scope

### 1) Partner Hub Page (Web)
- Single page, partner-facing (not parent-facing)
- Derived from `P_GTM_Partner_Unit_Economics_v1_0.md`
- Includes: system, causal chain, economics, bounded pilot model, proof signals
- Clear CTA: request partner pack or apply to pilot

### 2) Partner Pack (PDF)
- 6-10 slides/pages
- Operational and economic clarity
- Includes: system summary, measurement layer, pilot structure, economics snapshot, QA gates, proof-of-transfer

---

## Non-Goals

- No new parent-facing pages
- No speculative integrations or open-ended pilots
- No new pricing model beyond the graduated rate already defined

---

## Inputs (Source of Truth)

- `docs/P_GTM_Partner_Unit_Economics_v1_0.md` (core narrative)
- `docs/technical/PARTNER_PROOF_LAYER.md` (partner funnel + asset requirements)
- `docs/P_GTM_Graduate_Network_v1_0.md` (economics table + QA gates)
- `docs/P_GTM_Partnership_v3_0.md` (gap-container-exchange logic)

---

## Proposed Content Outline

### Partner Hub Page
1. Summary paragraph (not marketing claims, causal chain)
2. Problem framing (quality vs scale)
3. The engineered system (pedagogy + curriculum + measurement)
4. Causal chain -> unit economics
5. Bounded pilot model (pay for movement, not belief)
6. Proof from operation (early signals, directionally conclusive)
7. Why this is not consulting/content/research
8. CTA: Request partner pack

### Partner Pack (PDF)
1. Cover: Partner Unit Economics
2. The problem and the credence trap
3. The engineered system + measurement layer
4. Causal chain (outcomes -> conversion -> retention -> ARPU -> margin)
5. Pilot structure + minimum lead threshold + time bounds
6. Economics snapshot (graduated hourly model table)
7. QA gates + proof-of-transfer requirements
8. What partners provide vs what LuminAIT provides
9. Next steps + CTA

---

## Implementation Plan

1. Decide URL for hub page (`/partners/` or `/partners/tutors/`)
2. Draft hub page copy based on partner unit economics doc
3. Build hub page template (design system compliant)
4. Draft partner pack in Markdown or deck format
5. Export to PDF and host in repo (location to decide)
6. Link hub page CTA to partner pack or request form

---

## Success Criteria

- Hub page clearly communicates the causal chain and bounded pilot model
- Partner pack exists as a downloadable PDF
- CTA path is explicit and actionable
- Content aligns with partner proof layer requirements

---

## Open Questions

- Primary partner audience: individual tutors, tutoring companies, or institutional gatekeepers?
- Preferred CTA: request pack form vs direct download?
- Where should the PDF live in the repo (e.g., `docs/partners/` or `brand/partners/`)?
- Should the partner page be publicly indexed or hidden behind direct link?
