## Overview: The 5-Step Analytical Framework

Both programs are built on a single 5-step methodology:

| Step | Name | Description | Outcome |
|------|------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | **Context** | Author's world, structural choices, historical backdrop | Student can situate the text |
| 2 | **Pattern** | Core pattern driving the text (e.g., "Prophetic Witnessing") | Student can name the controlling mechanism |
| 3 | **Evidence** | Textual evidence: devices, quotes, moments | Student has organized evidence bank |
| 4 | **Analysis** | TVODE sentences connecting evidence to effect | Student writes analytical sentences |
| 5 | **Synthesis** | Thesis construction and full essay | Student produces complete analytical essay |

## Methodology Notes

### TVODE Framework
The TVODE sentence structure ensures students always connect evidence to effect:

```
[Technique] + [Verbal Signal] → [Observation] → [Deeper Effect] + [Evidence]
```

Example:
> Shakespeare's use of **dramatic irony** (Technique), specifically when Juliet states "My grave is like to be my wedding bed" (Evidence/Verbal Signal), **creates tragic pathos** (Observation) as the audience recognizes **prophetic truth in her casual metaphor** (Deeper Effect).

### DCCEPS Thesis Framework
The DCCEPS framework produces sophisticated thesis statements:

```
Through [Device], [Author] [Connection] to [Claim], 
demonstrating [Evidence Summary] which reveals [Pattern] 
and ultimately [Significance].
```

Example:
> Through structural dramatic irony, Shakespeare transforms audience knowledge into complicity, demonstrating how the Prologue's prophecy shadows every moment of hope. This "Prophetic Witnessing" pattern creates dread rather than suspense, ultimately positioning the audience as helpless witnesses to inevitable tragedy.
