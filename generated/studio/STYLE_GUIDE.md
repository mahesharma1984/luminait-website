# Style Guide: Video Production Writing

This document governs tone and writing style for all video production artifacts — teacher guides, video scripts, scene specs, and voiceover text.

## Core Principle

The writing should explain, not perform. The reader is a teacher, a student, or a production collaborator. They need clarity. They do not need to be impressed or sold to.

## Five Prohibitions

### 1. No antithesis as rhetorical trick

Do not construct paired oppositions that sound clever but flatten the analysis. If two things contrast, describe the contrast plainly.

**Bad:**
> "A memory is something you invite in. A flashback is something that kicks down the door."

This is theatre. The opposition (invite / kicks down) is memorable but imprecise. Flashbacks are still memories. The sentence sacrifices accuracy for rhythm.

**Good:**
> "A flashback differs from an ordinary memory because the character doesn't choose to recall it. The memory intrudes. In Ponyboy's case, the shift in speech rhythm — 'talking a little faster than I usually do' — signals the memory pushing through despite his resistance."

This says the same thing but names the evidence and explains the mechanism.

### 2. No dramatic punctuation

Do not use rhetorical questions, ellipsis for effect, capitalised single words for emphasis, or fragment sentences designed to create a dramatic beat.

**Bad:**
> "Panic is loud. But Trauma? Trauma is silent."

The capitalised "Trauma", the question mark, and the fragment sentence are all designed to create a dramatic pause. They substitute rhythm for explanation.

**Good:**
> "The external panic ('high-pitched screaming') contrasts with Ponyboy's internal response ('thought dully'). The word 'dully' shows his mind shutting down rather than matching the chaos around him."

**Bad:**
> "In *The Outsiders*, S.E. Hinton doesn't just show us what happens. She shows us how it *feels* to stop feeling."

**Good:**
> "This passage shows the gap between what is happening externally — the fire, the sirens, the screaming — and what Ponyboy registers internally. His narration goes flat. The word 'dully' marks the point where his processing shuts down."

### 3. No robotic pattern language

Do not use the phrase "executes the pattern" or any variation of it. Do not describe quotes as performing mechanical functions. The quote is evidence of something the author did. Say what the author did and why it matters.

**Bad:**
> "This internal monologue executes the pattern by contrasting Ponyboy's past misunderstanding with his current awareness."

**Good:**
> "The internal monologue here shows Ponyboy reassessing something he misunderstood at the time. The older narrator can articulate what the younger Ponyboy only felt."

**Bad:**
> "This foreshadowing executes the pattern by building suspense through ominous details that signal coming violence."

**Good:**
> "Hinton drops details here — the rings, the blue Mustang — that the reader won't understand until later. Ponyboy's narration includes them because, looking back, he knows what they meant."

---

### 4. No pushy sales language

Do not create artificial urgency. Do not shame the reader into action. Do not use imperative CTAs that imply the parent is failing their child.

**Bad:**
> "Don't let them miss the deeper meaning. Enquire now."

**Bad:**
> "Help your child see the difference. Enquire now."

**Bad:**
> "Give your child the words to explain the silence. Enquire now."

All three of these imply the parent is currently failing ("don't let them miss", "help your child", "give your child"). They create guilt, not information.

**Good:**
> "This is what Week 3 covers. The course page has scheduling and pricing."

**Good:**
> "Week 3 of the curriculum covers first-person narration, symbolism, and characterisation. Details are on the course page."

**Good (video outro end card):**
> "See the full 10-week course plan"
> luminait.app/[text-slug]

State what exists. Let the parent decide.

### 5. No vague abstraction

Do not hide behind phrases like "lived experience", "authentic testimony", "subtle temporal markers", or "insider status" without grounding them in specific textual evidence. If you cannot name the quote, the word, or the technique, the sentence is too vague.

**Bad:**
> "The narrator's insider status allows readers to experience socioeconomic conflict through lived experience rather than external observation."

This sentence contains no information. What insider status? Which conflict? What does "lived experience" mean here, concretely?

**Good:**
> "Ponyboy describes his gang's habits — the hair grease, the switchblades, walking in groups — as ordinary routine. Because he narrates from inside, readers absorb these details as normal before recognising they are markers of poverty and threat."

**Bad:**
> "The pattern operates by establishing Ponyboy as both experiencing adolescent and retrospective narrator through subtle temporal markers."

**Good:**
> "Ponyboy uses past tense ('I had only two things on my mind') and retrospective phrasing ('I was wishing') that signal he is remembering, not living, this moment. The gap between the boy who experienced it and the narrator who recalls it is the foundation of the novel's voice."

## Sentence Construction

- Use simple sentences or complex sentences. No theatrical fragments.
- One idea per sentence. If a sentence uses a semicolon, each clause should be able to stand on its own.
- Name the quote. Name the word. Name the technique. Specificity is the standard.
- When explaining a device, always ground it in the text: what the author wrote, what it reveals, why it matters at this point in the story.
- Do not stack adjectives or use intensifiers ("deeply powerful", "incredibly significant", "truly remarkable"). If the analysis is strong, it does not need decoration.

---

## Voice

- **Explanatory, not persuasive.** The goal is to help the reader understand how a literary device works. Not to convince them it is impressive.
- **Australian English spelling.** Analyse, recognise, colour, characterisation, organisation.
- **Second person ("you")** only when giving instructions. Third person for analysis.
- **No exclamation marks** in analytical writing.
- **No rhetorical questions** in analytical writing. If there is a question to answer, answer it in the next sentence.

## Applying This to Each Artifact

### Teacher Guides
The "Pattern Function" column in device/quote tables is where most problems occur. Replace "executes the pattern by..." with a plain explanation of what the device does at this moment in the novel and why the author chose it here.

### Video Scripts
The pedagogical setup (Steps 1-3) and the final CTA (Step 13) are where antithesis and sales language concentrate. Write the setup as a clear statement of what the scene will demonstrate. Write the CTA as a factual reference to the curriculum.

**Outro end card (Step 14):** Every video must end with a minimal text-only end card showing: book title, week/technique, and the factual CTA "See the full 10-week course plan" with the course URL. No images, no pressure language, no "Enrol now" or "Help your child" phrasing.

### Scene Specs
Labels and annotations should name the device and explain it in one sentence. Do not use labels as opportunities for dramatic copywriting.
