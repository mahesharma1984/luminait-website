### Phase 1: Intro
**Visual**: Book Cover -> Burning Church context image.
**Audio (Voiceover)**: 
"In *The Outsiders*, S.E. Hinton doesn't just show us what happens. She shows us how it *feels* to stop feeling."

### Phase 2: narration (The Text)
**Visual**: The full text appears on screen. No highlights yet.
**Audio**: 
"I tried to think but there was a high-pitched screaming going on, and I couldn't tell whether it was inside my head or out. Then I realized it was a siren. 'The fuzz,' I thought dully. 'The cops have come for us.' I tried to swallow a groan and wished wildly for Soda."

### Phase 3: Analysis (Deconstruction)
**Visual**: Highlight "high-pitched screaming" (Red ZigZag).
**Audio**: 
"First, the panic. 'High-pitched screaming.' He can't tell if it's the siren or his own brain. Valid panic."

**Visual**: Highlight "The fuzz, I thought dully" (Blue Box/Underline).
**Audio**: 
"But then, look at this. 'The fuzz, I thought **dully**'. 
Panic is loud. But Trauma? Trauma is silent."

**Visual**: Zoom in on "dully". 
**Audio**:
"He's in the back of an ambulance. The world is ending. And his internal monologue isn't screaming anymore. It's numb. That one word—'dully'—is the sound of a brain shutting down to survive."

### Phase 4: Conclusion & CTA
**Visual**: "Week 3: Internal Monologue" text overlay.
**Audio**:
