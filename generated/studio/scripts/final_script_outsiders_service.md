# Final Video Script: The Outsiders (Service Focus)

**Phase 0: The Hook**
*(Visual: Book Cover)*
"Most students read *The Outsiders* as a simple story about gangs. But there is a hidden pattern here that separates the A-grade essays from the rest."

**Phase 1: The Context**
*(Visual: Paul Newman slides in)*
"Take the very first page. 'I wished I looked like Paul Newman.' To us, that's just a name. To a greaser in 1967, he was *power*. He represents the world Ponyboy can't have."

**Phase 2: The Text**
*(Visual: Text Page zooms in)*
"Now, look at the writing. 'I had only two things on my mind...' He's worrying about a ride home. That's the **14-year-old kid** in the moment."

*(Visual: Box around 'I wishing I looked like...')*
"But the voice *telling* the story? That's the older, wiser Ponyboy looking back."

**Phase 3: The Metalanguage**
*(Visual: Label 'Dual Consciousness' appears)*
"We call this **Dual Consciousness**. The gap between what he felt *then* and what he knows *now*."

**Phase 4: The Outro (Service CTA)**
*(Visual: Cut to your face / Course Info Overlay)*
"This 'Dual Consciousness' pattern is exactly what we cover in Week 1 of our *Outsiders* program.
In our **10-week course**, we don't just read the book. We decode the system behind it.
We have spots open for Term 1. Click below to enquire."
