# Video Script: The Outsiders - First-Person (Aligned)

### Step 1
**Audio**: "To understand The Outsiders, you have to learn to see double. There are two Ponyboys in this book."

### Step 2
**Audio**: "When I stepped out into the bright sunlight from the darkness of the movie house, I had only two things on my mind: Paul Newman and a ride home."

### Step 3
**Audio**: "I was wishing I looked like Paul Newman—he looks tough and I don't."

### Step 4
**Audio**: "Meet Ponyboy Number One. He's fourteen. He's worried about being alone. He's worried about looking tough. He's living it right now."

### Step 5
**Audio**: "But who is writing this? Who knows exactly how he felt in that moment?"

### Step 6
**Audio**: "That's Ponyboy Number Two. The narrator. The survivor."

### Step 7
**Audio**: "First-Person Narration isn't just I. It's the gap between the scared kid living the story, and the safe man remembering it."

### Step 8
**Audio**: "We call this Retrospective Narration. It's the engine of the whole book. We interpret this in Week 3 of our Parent Curriculum."

### Step 9
**Audio**: "This is what Week 3 covers. The course page has details."
